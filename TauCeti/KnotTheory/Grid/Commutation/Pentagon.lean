# Pentagons of a column commutation

Let `G` be a grid diagram and let `b = finRotate n a` be the column following column `a`. The
column commutation `G' = G.swapColumns a b` is compared with `G` by drawing both diagrams on one
torus: the vertical grid line `β` between columns `a` and `b` (the line with index `b`) is
replaced by a curve `γ` which meets `β` in two points and bounds with it two thin bigons. The
column-`a` markings of `G` lie in one bigon, on the right of `γ`, and the column-`b` markings in
the other, on the left of `γ`, so that reading the markings off with `γ` in place of `β` gives
`G'`. Every other grid line is shared by the two diagrams, so a grid state of `G'` is again a
permutation of `Fin n` whose value at the line index `b` is its row on `γ`.

A pentagon from a state `x` of `G` to a state `y` of `G'` is an embedded disk bounded by five
arcs: starting at the point of `x` on `β`, it runs left along a horizontal circle to a point of
`y`, down a vertical line to a point of `x`, right along a horizontal circle to the point of `y`
on `γ`, up `γ` to one of the two intersection points of `β` and `γ`, and up `β` back to the start.
All corners are convex, which forces the intersection point to be the one, called the *turn
point*, at which `γ` crosses from the left of `β` to its right going upwards. Just below the turn
point lies the bigon carrying the column-`a` markings, and just above it the bigon carrying the
column-`b` markings.

The combined diagram is recorded by `GridDiagram.ColumnCommutationData`. Besides the adjacent
non-interleaving columns, it records the rows of the two intersections and certifies that the
markings lie in the appropriate two bigons. Every elementary column commutation admits such data
(`GridDiagram.isColumnCommutation_iff_exists_columnCommutationData`), so the map below is
available for each of them. The combinatorics of a pentagon is then recorded
with no curve in sight. Its corners are those of the oriented rectangle from `x` to `y` whose
terminal side is the line `b` (`GridPentagonBetween`, which extends `GridRectangleBetween`); the
turn row must lie in the rows spanned by the terminal side. The lattice points strictly inside
the pentagon are those strictly inside that rectangle,
so emptiness is `GridRectangleBetween.IsEmpty`. The markings it carries differ from those of the
rectangle only in the two columns next to `β` (`GridPentagonBetween.coveredSquares`): a
column-`a` marking is inside exactly when it lies above the turn point, where the terminal side
runs along `β`, and a column-`b` marking exactly when it lies below the turn point, where the
terminal side runs along `γ` to the right of `β`. A column-`a` marking in the row of the turn
point lies below it and a column-`b` marking lies above it, since they lie in the bigons below
and above the turn point respectively.

The pentagon map `Φ : GC⁻(G) → GC⁻(G')` (`GridDiagram.pentagonMap`) counts the empty pentagons
carrying no `X`-marking, each weighted by the product of the variables of the `O`-markings it
carries. The variable of an `O`-marking is the one attached to its column in `G'`, so the weight
of a covered column-`c` marking of `G` is `V_{swap a b c}`, and `Φ` is semilinear over the
renaming of the variables by `Equiv.swap a b`. The reverse comparison `GC⁻(G') → GC⁻(G)` counts
pentagons turning at the other intersection point; seen from `G'`, where `γ` is the grid line and
`β` the replacement curve, that is the same construction for `G'` with the square row of the
other intersection point as its turn row.

This file sets up the pentagons and the map. That `Φ` is a chain map, and that together with the
reverse map it is a chain homotopy equivalence via the hexagon-counting homotopies, is not proved
here.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween`: the combinatorial shape of a pentagon, recorded by its corners
  and its turn row.
* `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween.coveredSquares`: the squares of `G` whose marking lies inside the
  pentagon.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagons`: the empty pentagons carrying no `X`-marking.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagonWeight`: the monomial weighting a pentagon.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagonCoefficient`: the matrix coefficients of the pentagon map.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagonMap`: the pentagon map `Φ : GC⁻(G) → GC⁻(G.swapColumns a b)`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween.nonempty_iff`: a pentagon from `x` to `y` exists exactly when `y`
  is `x` with column `b` swapped against another column `j` and the turn row lies between the
  rows of `x` on `j` and on `b`; `Subsingleton` records that it is then unique.
* `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween.mem_coveredSquares`,
  `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween.mem_coveredSquares_iff_of_ne`: the covered squares, which agree
  with those of the underlying rectangle away from columns `a` and `b`.
* `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween.disjoint_coveredSquares_XSet_iff`: the `X`-avoidance condition
  column by column.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagonWeight_eq_prod_coveredSquares`,
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagonWeight_eq_prod_swapColumns`: the weight as a product over the
  covered squares, and as the product of the variables of the covered `O`-markings of the
  commuted diagram.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagonMap_single`, `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagonMap_apply_apply`: the
  action of the pentagon map on generators and its matrix coefficients.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.pentagonMapOnGenerator_support_subset`: the pentagon map moves a
  generator only by swapping its point on `β` against one other point.

## References

The pentagon map is the chain map `Φ_{βγ}` of Manolescu--Ozsváth--Szabó--Thurston, *On
combinatorial link Floer homology*, Section 3.1 (arXiv:math/0610559), and of
Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology for Knots and Links*, Section 5.1. The orientation
convention matches the rectangles of `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween`: the source state occupies
the lower-left and upper-right corners.

/-- The combinatorial shape of a pentagon for columns `a` and `finRotate n a`, with turn point in
square row `s`, from a grid state `x` to a grid state `y`.

It is recorded by the oriented rectangle from `x` to `y` with the same corners, whose terminal
side is the grid line `finRotate n a` replaced by the curve `γ`; the rows that side spans must
contain the turn row. The points of `x` sit at the lower-left and upper-right corners and those of
`y` at the upper-left and lower-right corners, the latter on `γ`. A pentagon-counting map only
uses these shapes through `GridDiagram.ColumnCommutationData`, which validates the commutation and
the placement of the markings relative to the turn. -/

/-- The pentagon map `Φ : GC⁻(G) → GC⁻(G.swapColumns C.column (finRotate n C.column))`

A generator `x` goes to the sum over the counted pentagons from `x` of their weights times their
targets. The map is semilinear over the renaming of the variables by
`Equiv.swap C.column (finRotate n C.column)`, which carries the variable of each `O`-marking in
`G` to its variable in the commuted diagram. -/
