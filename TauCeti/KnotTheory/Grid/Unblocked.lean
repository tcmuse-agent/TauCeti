# The unblocked grid complex `GC⁻`

The fully blocked differential `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDifferential` counts only
rectangles that avoid every marking,
so it forgets the `O`-markings entirely. The *unblocked* complex `GC⁻` remembers them:
it is the free module on grid states over the polynomial ring `R[V₀, …, V_{n-1}]`, one variable
`V_c` for the `O`-marking of column `c`, and its differential

`∂⁻ x = ∑_y ∑_r V^{O(r)} · y`

runs over the empty rectangles `r` from `x` to `y` carrying no `X`-marking, each weighted by the
monomial `V^{O(r)} = ∏ V_c` over the columns whose `O`-marking the rectangle covers. This is the
theory that survives (de)stabilization and whose homology is a module over `R[U]`. The simply
blocked theory is obtained by setting one selected variable, conventionally `V₀`, to zero; setting
every variable to zero gives the fully blocked count of `BlockedRectangle.lean`, which is
`fullyBlockedRectangleCount_eq_constantCoeff`.

Two conventions are fixed here.

*Which region carries a marking.* Markings sit at the centres of their squares, so a rectangle
carries the markings of the squares it covers, `GridRectangle.coveredSquares`, not those of the
grid points in its open interior. That is the region the Maslov and Alexander grading changes are
computed against in `Grading/MarkingCount.lean`, and it is the region used throughout this file.
It is also the region the marking-avoidance predicate `GridRectangle.AvoidsMarkings` of the grid
differential tests, under its other name `GridRectangle.squares`;
`GridRectangle.squares_eq_coveredSquares` identifies the two, which is what makes the fully blocked
count a specialization of a matrix coefficient here.

*Which grading the variables carry.* Giving `V_c` bidegree `(-2, -1)` makes the differential
homogeneous of bidegree `(-1, 0)`: `maslovO_sub_two_mul_card_OColumns_eq_maslovO_sub_one` and
`alexander_sub_card_OColumns_eq_alexander` say exactly that the term `V^{O(r)} · y` contributed by
a rectangle `r` from `x` to `y` has Maslov grading `M_O(x) - 1` and Alexander grading `A(x)`. The
Maslov statement needs the rectangle to be empty; the Alexander statement holds for every
`X`-avoiding rectangle.

The differential is defined over an arbitrary commutative coefficient ring. It squares to zero
only in characteristic two: over a general ring the rectangle counts must be corrected by a sign
assignment, a later stage of the roadmap.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.OColumns`: the columns whose `O`-marking a rectangle covers.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.OMonomial`: the monomial `V^{O(r)}` weighting a rectangle.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.unblockedRectangles`: the empty rectangles carrying no `X`-marking.
* `TauCeti.GridChainMinus`: the free `R[V₀, …, V_{n-1}]`-module on grid states.
* `TauCeti.GridChain.relabelColumnsRenameEquiv`: the semilinear equivalence on `GC⁻` that
  relabels columns and renames the coefficient variables.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.unblockedDifferential`: the unblocked differential, as a linear map over
  the polynomial ring.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.card_OColumns`: the number of covered `O`-columns is the number of
  `O`-markings among the covered squares.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.totalDegree_OMonomial`: the weight of a rectangle is a squarefree monomial
  whose degree is the number of `O`-markings the rectangle covers.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.OMonomial_eq_prod_coveredSquares`: the weight of a rectangle as a product
  over the squares it covers.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.unblockedDifferentialOnGenerator_support_subset`: the differential of a
  generator is supported on the column transpositions of that generator.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.unblockedDifferential_sq_single_apply`: the matrix of `∂⁻ ∘ ∂⁻` is a
  sum over intermediate states of products of matrix coefficients.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.maslovO_sub_two_mul_card_OColumns_eq_maslovO_sub_one`,
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.alexander_sub_card_OColumns_eq_alexander`: the differential is homogeneous
  of bidegree `(-1, 0)` once `V_c` is given bidegree `(-2, -1)`.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.constantCoeff_unblockedCoefficient`: the constant term of a matrix
  coefficient counts the contributing rectangles that carry no `O`-marking either.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangles_eq_filter`,
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangleCount_eq_constantCoeff`: those rectangles are the
  fully blocked ones, so the fully blocked matrix coefficient is the constant term of `∂⁻`.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.exists_mem_unblockedRectangles_of_mem_support_unblockedCoefficient`: every
  monomial of a matrix coefficient is the weight of a contributing rectangle.
* `TauCeti.GridChain.relabelColumnsRenameEquiv_symm_apply`: the inverse column relabeling and
  coefficient-renaming formula.
