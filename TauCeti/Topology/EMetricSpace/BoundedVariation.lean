# Limits of total variation bounds

This file transfers eventual upper bounds on the total variations of a family of maps to a
`liminf` bound on the total variation of a pointwise limit.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.eVariationOn_le_liminf_of_eventually_le`: an eventual bound on the total variations of
  a family of maps bounds the total variation of a pointwise limit by the `liminf` of the bounds.
