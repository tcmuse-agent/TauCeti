# Krull dimension of topological spaces: open covers and closed points

This file records facts about the topological Krull dimension and the codimension of points.

The Krull dimension of a space is the supremum of the Krull dimensions of the members of an open
cover: an irreducible closed subset meeting an open subset `U` is the closure of its trace on `U`,
so every chain of irreducible closed subsets of the whole space restricts to a chain of the same
length in any open subset containing a point of its smallest member. For schemes this is what
reduces dimension computations to affine opens. Similarly, the preimage of a set under an
embedding has the Krull dimension of the part of the set lying in the range.

On a T₀ topological space the specialization order is a partial order, so the codimension
`Order.coheight x` of a point is defined: it is the supremum of the lengths of the chains of
proper specializations of `x`. On a space all of whose points have codimension at most one, a
point of codimension exactly one is closed, since a proper specialization of such a point would
have codimension at least two.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.topologicalKrullDim_eq_iSup_of_isOpenEmbedding`: the Krull dimension of a space
  covered by the ranges of open embeddings is the supremum of the Krull dimensions of their
  domains.
* `Topology.IsEmbedding.topologicalKrullDim_preimage`: the preimage of a set under an embedding
  has the Krull dimension of the part of the set in the range.
* `TauCeti.isClosed_singleton_of_forall_coheight_le_one_of_coheight_eq_one`: on a T₀ space all
  of whose points have codimension at most one for the specialization order, a point of
  codimension one is closed.
* `TauCeti.coheight_le_topologicalKrullDim`: on a T₀ space, the codimension of a point is at
  most the Krull dimension of the space.
