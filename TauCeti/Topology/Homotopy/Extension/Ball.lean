# The unit sphere is a closed cofibration in the closed unit ball

The unit sphere of a real normed space has the homotopy extension property inside the closed
unit ball.  Concretely, the cylinder `I × D` over the closed unit ball `D` retracts onto
`{0} × D ∪ I × S`, where `S` is the unit sphere, by radial projection away from the point of the
cylinder axis at height `2`: the ray from that point through `(t, x)` leaves the cylinder either
through its bottom face or through its side, and the retraction sends `(t, x)` to that exit
point.

This is the basic example of a closed cofibration.  It is the geometric input for the homotopy
extension property of the inclusion of a skeleton of a CW complex into the next one, whose cells
are attached along maps defined on such spheres.

/-- Radial projection of the cylinder over the closed unit ball away from the point at height `2`
on its axis, written in the ambient coordinates `ℝ × E`.  Where the ray exits through the bottom
face the value has time coordinate `0`; on the remaining region the space coordinate has unit
norm.  The truncated norm `max ‖x‖ 2⁻¹` in the second branch agrees with `‖x‖` wherever that
branch is used, and keeps the formula continuous at `x = 0`. -/
