# Path homotopy helpers

Small path and path-homotopy lemmas, mostly for the universal-cover construction. The
quotient subpath identities are adapted from Kim Morrison's Mathlib universal-cover drafts,
especially [#31576](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/31576) and
[#38292](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/38292), following the earlier
Tau Ceti work in [#42](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCeti/pull/42).

`Path.exists_homotopy_forall_mem_of_isSimplyConnected` is not from that source: it records that
`SimplyConnectedSpace.paths_homotopic`, applied in a subspace `↥V`, yields a homotopy in the
ambient space whose intermediate paths all stay in `V`. Analytic continuation consumes it in
`Analysis/Complex/Conformal/GlobalBranch.lean`.

`Path.homotopic_of_continuous_square` is likewise adapted from Kim Morrison's
[#38292](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/38292). It is used by
`AlgebraicTopology/UniversalCover/BasedPath.lean`, where it previously lived privately, and by
`AlgebraicTopology/Sphere/Puncture.lean`. The lemma
`Path.Homotopic.refl_of_forall_mem_of_nullhomotopic` is not from #38292; it was factored out of
`AlgebraicTopology/SemilocallySimplyConnected/Basic.lean`.

`Path.exists_monotone_range_subpath_subset` subdivides a path, by the Lebesgue number lemma on the
unit interval, so that each consecutive subpath lies in a member of a given family of sets. It is
used for the generation half of the groupoid van Kampen theorem in
`AlgebraicTopology/FundamentalGroupoid/CoverGeneration.lean` and for the tube construction in
`AlgebraicTopology/UniversalCover/PathHomotopyDiscreteness.lean`.
