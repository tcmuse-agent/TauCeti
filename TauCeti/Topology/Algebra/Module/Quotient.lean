# Quotients of a topological module by an open submodule

The quotient of a topological module by an open submodule is discrete; in particular the quotient
of a discrete topological module by any submodule is discrete, since in a discrete module every
submodule is open.

Mathlib's `QuotientAddGroup.discreteTopology` is the statement for the quotient of a topological
additive group by an *open* subgroup, and supplies the whole proof; because it is a theorem
rather than an instance (Mathlib notes that `IsOpen` would have to be a class for that), instance
search cannot use it, so this file records it for `M ⧸ p` as a theorem, and the discrete case as
an instance. This is the same bridge from `QuotientAddGroup` to `Submodule.Quotient` that
Mathlib's own `Submodule.isTopologicalAddGroup_quotient` and `Submodule.t3_quotient_of_isClosed`
provide.
