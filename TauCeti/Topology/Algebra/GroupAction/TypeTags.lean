# Continuity of the distributive action on the additive type tag

`TauCeti.Algebra.GroupAction.TypeTags` makes a monoid `M` acting on a monoid `A` by monoid
endomorphisms act distributively on `Additive A`, and a monoid acting distributively on an additive
monoid `A` act by monoid endomorphisms on `Multiplicative A`. The topology of a type tag is that of
the underlying type, and the transported action is the same map `M × A → A`, so continuity of one
is continuity of the other. This file records that as the instances `Additive.continuousSMul` and
`Multiplicative.continuousSMul`. The first is what lets a multiplicative coefficient module — a
finite discrete `G`-module written multiplicatively, as in the extension dictionary — be fed to
the continuous cohomology of `Additive M`, whose hypotheses ask for a continuous action; the
second lets an additive coefficient module enter a construction stated for multiplicative ones,
such as the twisted product of a factor set. Likewise a continuous equivariant homomorphism of
such modules stays continuous when read additively
(`MulDistribMulActionHom.continuous_toAdditive`), as the coefficient maps of that cohomology
require.
