# The topological group extension built from a continuous factor set

A factor set `α : FactorSet G M` builds the group extension `1 → M → E_α → G → 1` whose underlying
set is `M × G` and whose multiplication is twisted by `α`. When `G` and `M` are topological groups,
the action of `G` on `M` is continuous and `α` is continuous, the product topology on `M × G` makes
`E_α` a topological group. The projection to `G` is an open quotient map, and — as soon as `G` is
`T1`, so that the range of the inclusion, the preimage of `{1}`, is closed — the inclusion of `M` is
a closed embedding. For `G` a profinite group and `M` a finite discrete module this exhibits `E_α`
as a profinite group, which is the extension attached to a continuous `2`-cocycle.

The topology is put on `TauCeti.FactorSet.Extension` unconditionally, as the product topology
transported along the coordinate equivalence `TauCeti.FactorSet.Extension.equivProd`. The group
structure itself needs no continuity at all; what needs `α` and the action of `G` on `M` to be
continuous is the compatibility of the group operations with the topology. The separation,
compactness and disconnectedness instances below hold for every factor set.

Continuity of a factor set is membership of the explicit complex of continuous cochains:
`TauCeti.FactorSet.ofMul_mem_Z2_iff` says that `α` is continuous exactly when it is a continuous
`2`-cocycle in the sense of `TauCeti.ContCohomology.Z2`, once read additively through
`Additive.ofMul`. Conversely `TauCeti.FactorSet.ofMemZ2` names the factor set of a normalized
continuous `2`-cocycle, so the two descriptions of the data are interchangeable.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.FactorSet.Extension.equivProd`: the twisted product is `M × G` as a type, and
  `TauCeti.FactorSet.Extension.instTopologicalSpace` transports the product topology along it.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.Extension.homeomorphProd`: the twisted product is `M × G` as a space.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.ofMemZ2`: the factor set named by a normalized continuous `2`-cocycle.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.FactorSet.Extension.isTopologicalGroup`: over a continuous action of `G` on `M`, a
  continuous factor set builds a topological group.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.isClosedEmbedding_inl` and `TauCeti.FactorSet.isQuotientMap_rightHom`: for
  `G` a `T1` space the copy of `M` is a closed subgroup, and the projection to `G` is an open
  quotient map, so `1 → M → E_α → G → 1` is an extension of topological groups.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.continuous_canonicalSection`: the canonical section is continuous, so the
  extension built from a continuous factor set carries a continuous normalized section.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.continuous_map`: the pushforward of a continuous factor set along a continuous
  equivariant homomorphism of coefficient modules is continuous.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.ofMul_mem_Z2_iff`: continuity of a factor set is membership of the explicit
  complex of continuous cochains.
