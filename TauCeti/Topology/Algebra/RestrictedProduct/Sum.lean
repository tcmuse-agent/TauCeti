# Splitting a restricted product over a sum of index types

A restricted product of groups indexed by `ι₁ ⊕ ι₂` is the product of the restricted products
over the two summands.  The algebraic content is that a subset of `ι₁ ⊕ ι₂` is finite exactly
when its preimages under `Sum.inl` and `Sum.inr` are, so the restrictedness conditions match up
in both directions; the equivalence `restrictedProductSum` is the restriction of
`Equiv.sumPiEquivProdPi` to the restricted subtypes.

Only the cofinite filter is treated here, on `ι₁ ⊕ ι₂` and on both summands. For an arbitrary
filter `𝓕` on `ι₁ ⊕ ι₂` the summand filters of the splitting are the comaps `𝓕.comap Sum.inl`
and `𝓕.comap Sum.inr`, which need not be cofinite: for `𝓕 = 𝓟 (Set.range Sum.inl)` the second
is `⊥`, and the right factor is the unrestricted product `Π j, G (Sum.inr j)`. The cofinite
filter is the case in which both comaps are cofinite again, because `Sum.inl` and `Sum.inr` are
injective (`Function.Injective.comap_cofinite_eq`). That general form is not stated here.

The forward map is continuous for every reference family (`continuous_restrictedProductSum`).
The inverse is a map out of a product of two restricted products, and its continuity depends on
the reference family.  On principal stages it is continuous for every family
(`continuous_restrictedProductSum_symm_comp_prodMap_inclusion`), and Mathlib's universal
property with parameters passes from the stages to the restricted products when the reference
subgroups are open: over both summands (`continuous_restrictedProductSum_symm`, the openness
hypothesis under which `RestrictedProduct.isTopologicalGroup` holds), or over the right summand
alone when the left summand is finite (`continuous_restrictedProductSum_symm_of_finite_left`).
Under either hypothesis `restrictedProductSum` is a homeomorphism.  Openness cannot be dropped
altogether: `not_continuous_restrictedProductSum_symm` exhibits a family with trivial reference
subgroups for which the inverse is discontinuous.

Everything here except that counterexample is also stated for additive groups
(`addRestrictedProductSum`, …).
