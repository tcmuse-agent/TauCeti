# Restricted products of groups away from a set of indices

This file names the restricted product of a family of groups relative to a family of reference
subgroups over the indices outside a set `S`. This is the shape in which restricted products
appear when the local groups at a finite set of places are set apart from the rest of an adelic
group: the finite adelic points away from a finite set of places.

It then constructs the restriction homomorphism from the restricted product to the restricted
product away from `S`, which forgets the coordinates indexed by `S`. This is Mathlib's
`RestrictedProduct.mapAlongMonoidHom` along the inclusion `{i // i ∉ S} → ι`, which carries the
cofinite filter to the cofinite filter because it is injective. Its coordinate formula, its
continuity for every reference family, and its compatibility with nested index sets are the
facts the decomposition `awayDecomposition` of a restricted product along a finite set of indices
needs.

No finiteness of `S` is assumed anywhere: the away-`S` restricted product and the restriction to
it make sense for every set of indices.

Everything here is also stated for additive groups (`RestrictedProductAddGroupAway`,
`addRestrictAway`, …).
