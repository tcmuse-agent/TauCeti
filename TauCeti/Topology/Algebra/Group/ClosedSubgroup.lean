# Closed subgroups of topological groups

This file collects constructions on closed subgroups of a topological group.

An isomorphism of topological groups carries closed subgroups to closed subgroups.  This is
packaged as an order isomorphism, together with its compatibility with normality: the transport of
a normal closed subgroup is normal.  An isomorphism carrying one normal subgroup onto another also
induces an isomorphism of the quotient topological groups, so a normal closed subgroup can be
transported without changing the topological quotient it defines.

A closed subgroup `H` of `A × G` projecting onto `G`, that is with `∀ g, ∃ a, (a, g) ∈ H`, is a
closed relation from `G` to `A` defined everywhere. When `A` is compact, the fibre
`{a | (a, g) ∈ H}` over each `g` is compact, so along a chain of such subgroups the fibres of the
intersection are nonempty, and Zorn's lemma supplies a minimal such subgroup below any given one.

## Main definitions

* `ContinuousMulEquiv.closedSubgroupOrderIso`: transport of closed subgroups along an isomorphism
  of topological groups.
* `ContinuousMulEquiv.quotientCongr`: the induced isomorphism of quotient topological groups.

## Main results

* `Subgroup.forall_exists_mem_sInf_of_isChain`: the intersection of a chain of closed subgroups
  of `A × G` projecting onto `G` still projects onto `G`.
* `Subgroup.exists_minimal_isClosed_le`: a closed subgroup of `A × G` projecting onto `G` contains
  a minimal closed subgroup projecting onto `G`.

/-- A topological group isomorphism carrying a normal subgroup onto a normal subgroup induces an
isomorphism of the quotient topological groups.  This is `QuotientGroup.congr` together with the
continuity of both directions, which follows from the quotient-map property of the two projections.

For a normal closed subgroup `N : ClosedSubgroup G` the hypothesis holds by `rfl` on the
transported subgroup, so `e.quotientCongr N (e.closedSubgroupOrderIso N) rfl` is the induced
isomorphism `G ⧸ N.toSubgroup ≃ₜ* H ⧸ (e.closedSubgroupOrderIso N).toSubgroup`. -/
