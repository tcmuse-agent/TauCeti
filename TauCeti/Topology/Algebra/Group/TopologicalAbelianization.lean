# Functoriality of the topological abelianization, and the conjugation action on `N^{ab}`

The topological abelianization `G^{ab} = G ⧸ closure [G, G]` of a topological group `G` is
Mathlib's `TopologicalAbelianization G`. This file adds two pieces of API to it.

**Functoriality.** A continuous homomorphism `f : G →* H` carries the topological closure of the
commutator subgroup of `G` into that of `H`, so it induces a continuous homomorphism
`TopologicalAbelianization.map f hf : G^{ab} →* H^{ab}`, compatible with identities and
composition.

**The conjugation action.** Let `N` be a normal subgroup of `G`. Conjugation by `G` preserves
`N`, hence its commutator subgroup, hence the topological closure of the latter, so it descends
to an action of `G` on `N^{ab}` by continuous group automorphisms; and an element of `N` acts on
`N^{ab}` trivially, because conjugation by it is an inner automorphism of `N`, so the action
factors through `G ⧸ N`. Both actions are recorded as `MulDistribMulAction` instances, the first
for Mathlib's conjugation type synonym `ConjAct G`, the second for the quotient `G ⧸ N`, and the
action of `G ⧸ N` is jointly continuous. On classes it is `(g : G ⧸ N) • (n : N^{ab}) = g n g⁻¹`,
the convention of `MulAut.conjNormal`.

This is the structure of Labute's relation module in the classification of Demushkin groups: for
a continuous character `χ` of a free pro-`p` group `F`, its kernel `X` is normal, and Labute's
`E = X ⧸ (X, X)` is `TopologicalAbelianization X` with `Γ = F ⧸ X` acting by conjugation
(Labute, §4, p. 121). Labute writes the action as `[y] · [x] = y⁻¹ x y`, which is the *inverse*
of the convention above: his `[y] · [x]` is `[y]⁻¹ • [x]` here (`mk_inv_smul_mk`). His formula
defines a left action when `Γ` is abelian, as it is in his setting (`Γ ≅ Im χ ≤ ℤ_pˣ`); for a
general normal subgroup it is a right action, which is why the instance uses Mathlib's convention
and Labute's action is recovered by precomposing with the inversion of the acting group.

## Main definitions

* `TopologicalAbelianization.map`: the homomorphism `G^{ab} →* H^{ab}` induced by a continuous
  homomorphism `G →* H`.
* The instances `MulDistribMulAction (ConjAct G) (TopologicalAbelianization N)` and
  `MulDistribMulAction (G ⧸ N) (TopologicalAbelianization N)`: conjugation on the topological
  abelianization of a normal subgroup, and its factorization through `G ⧸ N`.

## Main results

* `TopologicalAbelianization.map_mk`, `TopologicalAbelianization.continuous_map`,
  `TopologicalAbelianization.map_id`, `TopologicalAbelianization.map_comp`: the characteristic
  properties of `map`.
* `TopologicalAbelianization.mk_smul_mk`: the class of `g : G` acts on the class of `n : N` by
  the class of `g * n * g⁻¹`; `TopologicalAbelianization.mk_inv_smul_mk` is Labute's form of
  the same action, the inverse of the class of `g` acting by the class of `g⁻¹ * n * g`.
* `TopologicalAbelianization.toConjAct_smul_eq_self_of_mem`: elements of `N` act trivially on
  `N^{ab}`.
* The instances `ContinuousConstSMul (ConjAct G) (TopologicalAbelianization N)` and
  `ContinuousSMul (G ⧸ N) (TopologicalAbelianization N)`.
* `TopologicalAbelianization.map_inclusion_smul`,
  `TopologicalAbelianization.map_inclusion_quotient_smul`,
  `TopologicalAbelianization.map_inclusion_mk_smul`: for normal `R ≤ N`, the map
  `R^{ab} →* N^{ab}` induced by the inclusion is equivariant for conjugation by `G`, and
  intertwines the actions of `G ⧸ R` and `G ⧸ N` along the canonical map `G ⧸ R →* G ⧸ N`.
* `TopologicalAbelianization.topologicalClosure_closure_univ_smul_image_mk_eq_top`: if `N` is
  the closed normal closure of a set `S`, the `(G ⧸ N)`-orbit of the classes of the elements of
  `S` topologically generates `N^{ab}`.
