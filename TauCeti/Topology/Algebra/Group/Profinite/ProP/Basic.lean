# Pro-p groups

A topological group is pro-`p` when each of its continuous finite quotients is a `p`-group.
For the unbundled profinite groups used in Tau Ceti, these quotients are represented by the
quotients by open normal subgroups. This file introduces that quotient-form predicate and its
basic covariant API: abstract `p`-groups are pro-`p`, continuous surjective images of pro-`p`
groups are pro-`p`, and hence so are topological quotients. It also records invariance under
topological group isomorphism and agreement with `IsPGroup` for a discrete topology.

Closedness of a normal subgroup is not needed for the predicate to descend to its quotient.
It is needed only when one wants the quotient of a profinite group to be profinite again; that
separate topological fact is supplied by `QuotientGroup.instTotallyDisconnectedSpace`.

## Main results

* `IsProP`: every quotient by an open normal subgroup is a `p`-group.
* `isProP_iff`: the defining property, as a lemma usable outside this module.
* `IsPGroup.isProP`: an abstract `p`-group with any topology is pro-`p`.
* `isProP_of_module_zmod`: a commutative group whose additive copy is a `ZMod p`-module, for
  instance an elementary abelian group, is pro-`p`.
* `isProP_iff_isPGroup`: for a discrete topology, pro-`p` agrees with `IsPGroup`.
* `isProP_multiplicative_zmod_pow`: the discrete cyclic group `ℤ/pⁿ` is pro-`p`.
* `IsProP.exists_forall_pow_pow_eq_one`: each finite quotient of a pro-`p` group is killed by
  a power of `p`.
* `IsProP.of_surjective`: a continuous surjective image of a pro-`p` group is pro-`p`.
* `IsProP.quotient`: a quotient of a pro-`p` group by a normal subgroup is pro-`p`.
* `IsProP.top`: the top subgroup of a pro-`p` group is pro-`p`.
* `IsProP.isPGroup_range`: a continuous homomorphism from a pro-`p` group to a discrete group
  has a `p`-group as its range.
* `IsProP.isPGroup_map_mk'`: the image of a pro-`p` subgroup in the quotient by an open normal
  subgroup is a `p`-group.
* `isProP_congr`: the predicate is invariant under topological group isomorphism.
