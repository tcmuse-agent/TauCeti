# Finite generation and the Frattini quotient

A profinite pro-`p` group is topologically finitely generated if and only if its Frattini
quotient is finite, equivalently if and only if its Frattini subgroup is open. This turns
topological finite generation into a finiteness condition on the maximal elementary abelian
quotient, as needed for the finite-dimensional form of the Burnside basis theorem.

Openness of the Frattini subgroup passes to open subgroups: an open subgroup of a compact
topologically finitely generated group is itself compact and topologically finitely generated, so
`TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.isOpen_map_subtype_proPFrattini` sees its Frattini
subgroup as an open subgroup of the ambient group. This is the inductive step that makes the lower
`p`-series and the Frattini series of such a group consist of open subgroups.

The forward implication holds for any compact topologically finitely generated group:
there are only finitely many open normal subgroups of index `p`, so their intersection is
open. For the converse, lift the finite set of all elements of the quotient and apply the
topological Burnside theorem. In particular, the converse uses the pro-`p` hypothesis.
