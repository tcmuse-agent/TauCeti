# The completed group algebra of a profinite group

For a topological group `Γ` and a commutative ring `R`, the **completed group algebra**
`R[[Γ]]` is the inverse limit of the group algebras `R[Γ ⧸ U]`
over the open normal subgroups `U` of `Γ`: an element is a family of elements of the group
algebras `R[Γ ⧸ U]`, compatible along the ring homomorphisms `R[Γ ⧸ U] → R[Γ ⧸ V]` induced by
the quotient maps `Γ ⧸ U → Γ ⧸ V` for `U ≤ V`. The index set is the open *normal* subgroups,
because `Γ ⧸ U` has to be a group for `R[Γ ⧸ U]` to be a group algebra. For `R = ℤ_[p]` and
`Γ` a profinite group this is the Iwasawa algebra `ℤ_p[[Γ]]`, the ring over which the relation
modules in Labute's classification of Demushkin groups are studied.

It is an `R`-algebra; each group element `γ` gives an element `of R Γ γ`, the family of its
classes, and each open normal subgroup `U` gives the projection `proj R Γ U` onto `R[Γ ⧸ U]`,
which is surjective. Two elements with the same projections are equal, and these two facts are
the inverse-limit description of the algebra. Its universal property is `lift`: a compatible
family of `R`-algebra homomorphisms into the levels `R[Γ ⧸ U]` assembles into an `R`-algebra
homomorphism into `R[[Γ]]`, unique with the prescribed projections (`algHom_ext`).

When `R` is a topological ring, the completed group algebra carries the inverse-limit topology:
the coarsest topology making every coefficient of every projection continuous. Scalar
multiplication by `R` is continuous when multiplication in `R` is. When every open normal
quotient `Γ ⧸ U` is finite, as it is for a compact `Γ` with separately continuous
multiplication, the completed algebra is a topological ring, and it is compact when `R` is
compact Hausdorff. It is totally disconnected when `R` is, and the map from `Γ` is continuous.
It is commutative when `Γ` is, stated as the `IsMulCommutative` mixin and as a `CommRing`
structure extending the ring structure, so that no second multiplication is installed.

For a general topological group `Γ` the map `of R Γ` need not be injective and the algebra may be
commutative without `Γ` being so (both happen for an indiscrete `Γ`, whose only open normal
subgroup is `Γ` itself). When `Γ` is profinite its open normal subgroups separate the points, so
over a nontrivial `R` the group elements are distinct in `R[[Γ]]` (`of_injective`), the map
`of R Γ` is a closed embedding for Hausdorff `R` (`isClosedEmbedding_of`), and the algebra is
commutative exactly when `Γ` is (`isMulCommutative_iff`).

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra R Γ`: the completed group algebra `R[[Γ]]`.
* `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.proj R Γ U`: the projection onto `R[Γ ⧸ U]`.
* `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.of R Γ`: the group elements inside `R[[Γ]]`.
* `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.mk`: an element from a compatible family of elements
  of the group algebras `R[Γ ⧸ U]`.
* `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.lift`: the `R`-algebra homomorphism into `R[[Γ]]` assembled
  from a compatible family of `R`-algebra homomorphisms into the group algebras `R[Γ ⧸ U]`.
* `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.coeffFamily R Γ`: all coefficients of all projections, the map
  along which the topology is induced.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.ext`, `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.proj_surjective`: the
  inverse-limit description.
* `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.proj_lift`, `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.algHom_ext`: the
  universal property, an algebra homomorphism into `R[[Γ]]` is determined by its compositions
  with the projections and `lift` has the prescribed ones.
* `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.proj_of`: a group element projects to the corresponding basis
  element of the quotient group algebra.
* `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.isEmbedding_coeffFamily`,
  `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.isClosedEmbedding_coeffFamily`: the topology is the
  inverse-limit topology, and the compatible families form a closed subset of the product.
* `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.continuous_of`: the group elements depend continuously on the
  group element.
* `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.exists_mem_span_range_of_proj_eq`,
  `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.dense_span_range_of`: every element agrees at any given level
  with an `R`-linear combination of group elements, so the span of the group elements is dense.
* `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.isUniformInducing_coeffFamily`: over a uniform coefficient ring,
  the uniformity of the completed group algebra is the one induced along the coefficient map,
  and the algebra is a uniform additive group when `R` is.
* `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.of_injective`,
  `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.isClosedEmbedding_of`,
  `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra.isMulCommutative_iff`: for profinite `Γ` over a nontrivial `R`,
  the group elements are distinct, form a closed copy of `Γ` when `R` is Hausdorff, and the
  algebra is commutative exactly when `Γ` is.
* The instances `IsTopologicalRing`, `ContinuousSMul R`, `CompactSpace`,
  `TotallyDisconnectedSpace`, `T2Space`, `UniformSpace` and `IsUniformAddGroup`, the
  `NoZeroSMulDivisors R` instance for `R` without zero divisors, and the `IsMulCommutative` and
  `CommRing` instances for commutative `Γ`.
