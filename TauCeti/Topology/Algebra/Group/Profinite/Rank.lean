# The topological generator rank of a profinite group

The **topological generator rank** `topologicalGeneratorRank G` of a topological group `G` is the
least cardinality of a subset that converges to `1` and generates a dense subgroup. Convergence to
`1` is not decoration: without it the invariant is the least cardinality of a dense subgroup, which
is the wrong notion for a profinite group. A product of continuum many copies of `ℤ/p` has a
countable dense subgroup, yet every generating set converging to `1` has cardinality `2 ^ ℵ₀`,
which is the number the Frattini quotient and every later rank formula see.

For a profinite `G` the family being minimized over is nonempty — that is
`TauCeti.exists_convergesToOne_topologicallyGenerates` — so the infimum is attained, cardinals
being well-ordered. Attainment is what all the theorems below run on: an isomorphism-invariant,
surjection-monotone cardinal whose finiteness is exactly
`TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated`.

Alongside it sits the natural-number accessor `topologicalGeneratorRankNat G h`, the least
cardinality of a *finite* topological generating set, available exactly when `G` is topologically
finitely generated. Every numerical rank statement — Schreier-type bounds, deficiencies, Euler
formulas, anything that subtracts ranks — is about the accessor rather than about the cardinal,
and `TauCeti.topologicalGeneratorRankNat_eq_topologicalGeneratorRank` is what ties the two
together. A comparison of the cardinal ranks of two groups is stated in `Cardinal.lift` form, so
that the groups need not share a universe, with the same-universe form derived from it. The
accessor needs no compactness and no convergence condition, since a finite set converges to `1`
in any topological group; compactness enters only through the comparison with the cardinal
rank.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.topologicalGeneratorRank`: the least cardinality of a topological generating set
  converging to `1`.
* `TauCeti.topologicalGeneratorRankNat`: the least cardinality of a finite topological generating
  set, for a topologically finitely generated group.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.topologicalGeneratorRank_le`: a topological generating set converging to `1` bounds the
  rank by its cardinality.
* `TauCeti.lift_topologicalGeneratorRank_congr`, `TauCeti.topologicalGeneratorRank_congr`: the
  rank is invariant under a topological group isomorphism, with no compactness needed.
* `TauCeti.exists_convergesToOne_mk_eq_topologicalGeneratorRank`: in a profinite group the
  infimum is attained.
* `TauCeti.lift_topologicalGeneratorRank_le_of_surjective`,
  `TauCeti.topologicalGeneratorRank_le_of_surjective`,
  `TauCeti.topologicalGeneratorRank_quotient_le`: a continuous surjection does not raise the rank.
* `TauCeti.topologicalGeneratorRank_lt_aleph0_iff`: the rank is finite exactly under topological
  finite generation.
* `TauCeti.topologicalGeneratorRank_eq_zero_iff`: the rank vanishes exactly on the trivial group.
* `TauCeti.topologicalGeneratorRankNat_le_of_surjective`,
  `TauCeti.topologicalGeneratorRankNat_congr`: the accessor does not increase along a continuous
  surjection and is invariant under a topological group isomorphism.
* `TauCeti.topologicalGeneratorRankNat_le_of_openSubgroup_of_finiteIndex`,
  `TauCeti.topologicalGeneratorRankNat_le_of_openSubgroup`: **the Schreier bound**
  `d(U) ≤ 1 + [G : U] * (d(G) - 1)` for an open subgroup `U` of finite index, in particular for
  every open subgroup of a compact group.
* `TauCeti.topologicalGeneratorRankNat_eq_topologicalGeneratorRank`: the accessor computes the
  cardinal rank whenever it is available.
* `TauCeti.topologicalGeneratorRankNat_eq_rank`: on a discrete group the accessor is Mathlib's
  `Group.rank`.
