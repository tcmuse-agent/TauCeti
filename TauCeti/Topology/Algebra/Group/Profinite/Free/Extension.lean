# Extensions of a free pro-`p` group split

Let `F = freeProP p X` be the free pro-`p` group on a type `X`, and let `1 → M → E → F → 1` be an
extension of topological groups with profinite total group `E` and pro-`p` kernel `M`. Then `E` is
pro-`p`, so the universal property of `F` extends any choice of preimages of the generators to a
continuous homomorphism `F → E`, which is a section of the projection because both composites agree
on the generators. So the extension splits by a continuous homomorphic section taking any
prescribed preimages on the generators
(`GroupExtension.exists_splitting_continuous_freeProP_forall_apply_of_eq`), and in particular
splits even when the total group lives in a different universe
(`GroupExtension.exists_splitting_continuous_freeProP`).

No finiteness of `X` is needed: the universal property and projectivity of `freeProP p X` hold
for every type. Read through the classification of profinite extensions
by continuous `H²`, this is the vanishing of `H²` of a free pro-`p` group, proved in
`TauCeti.Topology.Algebra.Group.Profinite.Free.Cohomology`.

## Main results

* `GroupExtension.exists_splitting_continuous_freeProP_forall_apply_of_eq`: a profinite extension
  of a free pro-`p` group by a pro-`p` group has a continuous homomorphic section with prescribed
  values on the generators, for any choice of preimages of the generators.
* `GroupExtension.exists_splitting_continuous_freeProP`: every profinite extension of a free
  pro-`p` group by a pro-`p` group splits by a continuous homomorphic section.

/-- **A continuous homomorphic section with prescribed values on the generators.** Given an
extension `1 → M → E → freeProP p X → 1` of topological groups with profinite total group and
pro-`p` kernel, and a preimage `e x` of each generator `of x`, there is a continuous homomorphic
section sending `of x` to `e x`: the universal property of `freeProP p X` extends `e` to a
continuous homomorphism, which is a section because both composites agree on the generators. -/
