# Quotients of topological groups by normal subgroups

Generic facts about the quotient of a topological group by a normal subgroup, phrased for the
unbundled classes `[Group G] [TopologicalSpace G] [IsTopologicalGroup G]`: neither compactness
nor total disconnectedness is needed, so the results apply in particular to profinite groups.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.quotientOpenSubgroup`: the image of an open subgroup of `G` in `G ⧸ N`, as an open
  subgroup.
* `TauCeti.quotientOpenSubgroupMap`: the quotient homomorphism restricted to an open subgroup.

## Main results

* `QuotientGroup.instDiscreteTopology`: the quotient of a discrete group by any subgroup is
  discrete.
* `QuotientGroup.isClopen_image_mk`: the image of an open subgroup of `G` under the
  quotient map `G → G ⧸ N` is clopen.
* `QuotientGroup.comapMk'OpenNormalOrderIso`: open normal subgroups of `G ⧸ N` correspond,
  as lattices, to the open normal subgroups of `G` containing `N`.
* `TauCeti.quotientOpenSubgroup_index`: quotienting by a subgroup of `U` preserves the index
  of `U`.
