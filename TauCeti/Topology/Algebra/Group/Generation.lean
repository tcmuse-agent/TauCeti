# Topological generation of a topological group

A subset of a topological group *generates it topologically* when the subgroup it generates is
dense, that is when `(Subgroup.closure s).topologicalClosure = ⊤`. This file introduces the
predicate `IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated`, asking for a *finite* topological generating set,
and its basic API.

The predicate is covariant: a topological generating set is carried to a topological generating
set by any continuous homomorphism with dense range, hence in particular by a continuous
surjection and so to every quotient. It is invariant under a topological group isomorphism, and
it has the uniqueness half one expects of a notion of generation — a continuous homomorphism into
a Hausdorff monoid is determined by its values on a topological generating set, as is a
homomorphism with open kernel into an arbitrary group. Counting the latter over a finite target
is what bounds the supply of open subgroups of a compact group.

For a profinite group topological finite generation is detected by the finite quotients; that
criterion is in `TauCeti/Topology/Algebra/Group/Profinite/Generation.lean`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated`: some finite subset generates a dense subgroup.
* `TauCeti.topologicalClosure_closure_image_eq_top`: the image of a topological generating set
  under a continuous homomorphism with dense range is a topological generating set.
* `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.of_denseRange`,
  `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.of_surjective`,
  `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.quotient`: topological finite generation passes along
  continuous homomorphisms with dense range, along continuous surjections, and to quotients.
* `TauCeti.topologicalClosure_closure_sup_eq_top_iff`: a subset together with a normal subgroup
  `K` topologically generates `G` exactly when its image topologically generates `G ⧸ K`.
* `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.of_openSubgroup_of_finiteIndex`,
  `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.of_openSubgroup`: topological finite generation
  passes to open finite-index subgroups, in particular to open subgroups of compact groups.
* `MonoidHom.eq_of_eqOn_of_topologicalClosure_closure_eq_top`: a continuous homomorphism into a
  Hausdorff monoid is determined by its values on a topological generating set.
* `MonoidHom.eq_of_eqOn_of_isOpen_ker`: the same uniqueness statement for a homomorphism with
  open kernel, for which the target carries no topology.
* `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.finite_monoidHom_isOpen_ker`: only finitely many
  homomorphisms with open kernel go from a topologically finitely generated group to a fixed
  finite group.
