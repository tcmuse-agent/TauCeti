# Length spaces and geodesic spaces

A metric space is a *length space* when the distance between two points is the infimum of the
lengths of the continuous curves joining them, and a *geodesic space* when that infimum is
realised by a curve on `[0, 1]` whose distance function is the affine one, `dist (γ s) (γ t) =
|s - t| * dist x y`. This file sets up both notions, together with the length of a curve that
they are phrased in terms of, and proves that a geodesic space is a length space.

## The length of a curve

The length of a curve `γ : ℝ → X` over a parameter interval `[a, b]` is the supremum of the sums
`∑ i, edist (γ (u (i + 1))) (γ (u i))` over finite increasing families `u` in `[a, b]`. This is
exactly Mathlib's total variation `eVariationOn γ (Set.Icc a b)`, which this file uses directly.
Two conventions are inherited deliberately:

* curves are functions on all of `ℝ`, read on a parameter interval, rather than functions on a
  subtype. This is the convention of `Manifold.pathELength I γ a b`, the Riemannian length to be
  compared against, and it avoids subtype juggling in the API;
* the value is an extended nonnegative real, since a continuous curve can have infinite length.

Mathlib's bundled `Path x y` is bridged to this convention in both directions, by
`TauCeti.IsCurveJoining.joined` and `TauCeti.isCurveJoining_extend`.

## Continuity is load-bearing

The infimum defining a length space must range over *continuous* curves. Dropping continuity makes
every metric space a length space: the two-valued curve which is `x` on `[0, 1)` and `y` at `1`
already has length `edist x y`, by `eVariationOn.edist_le`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsCurveJoining γ x y` — `γ` is continuous on `[0, 1]` and runs from `x` to `y` there.
* `TauCeti.IsGeodesicSegment γ x y` — `γ` parametrises a shortest curve from `x` to `y`
  proportionally to arclength on `[0, 1]`.
* `TauCeti.IsLengthSpace X` — the distance is the infimum of the lengths of the joining curves.
* `TauCeti.IsGeodesicSpace X` — any two points are joined by a geodesic segment.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_isCurveJoining_of_continuousOn` shows that the parameter interval `[0, 1]` is no
  loss of generality.
* `TauCeti.IsGeodesicSegment.eVariationOn_eq_edist` — a geodesic segment realises the distance
  between any two of its points, and in particular between its endpoints.
* `TauCeti.IsGeodesicSpace.toIsLengthSpace` — a geodesic space is a length space; there the
  infimum is attained, by `TauCeti.IsGeodesicSpace.exists_eVariationOn_eq`.
* `TauCeti.IsLengthSpace.pathConnectedSpace` — a nonempty length space with finite distances is
  path connected.
* `TauCeti.instIsGeodesicSpace` — a real seminormed space is a geodesic space, its geodesic
  segments being the affine ones (`TauCeti.isGeodesicSegment_lineMap`).
