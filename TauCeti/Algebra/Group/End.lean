# Powers of an additively indexed family of endomorphisms

A family `f : ℕ → M →* M` of endomorphisms of a type with multiplication and a distinguished
one, indexed additively so that `f 0` is the identity and `f (a + b)` is the composite of `f a`
and `f b`, is an additive character `AddChar ℕ (Monoid.End M)`. Thus multiplication of indices
corresponds to powers in the endomorphism monoid: the `m`-th power of `f k` is `f (k * m)`.
No associativity or identity laws for multiplication on `M` are needed.

This is the shape of the iteration laws of an iterated Frobenius, `Frob_0 = id` and
`Frob_(a + b) = Frob_a ∘ Frob_b`, and the lemma packages Mathlib's `AddChar.map_nsmul_eq_pow`
for that shape once, so that each Chevalley carrier only supplies its two iteration laws.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Monoid.End.pow_eq_of_add_eq_comp`: `f k ^ m = f (k * m)` in `Monoid.End M`.
