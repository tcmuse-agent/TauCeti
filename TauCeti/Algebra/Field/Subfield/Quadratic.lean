# Vanishing cross terms over subfields

If `x²`, `a`, and `b` lie in a subfield but `x` does not, squaring `a + b * x` can land in
that subfield only when `a * b = 0`, provided the ambient field has characteristic different
from two.
This criterion is used in square-class descent through quadratic extensions.

/-- **Vanishing cross term in a quadratic step.** If `x² ∈ F` but `x ∉ F`, then a square
`(a + b * x) ^ 2` of a normal-form element that lands back in `F` has no cross term: `a * b = 0`.
This is where characteristic not two enters, through `2 ≠ 0` in `L`. It holds for an arbitrary
subfield `F` of `L`; no ambient base field or algebra tower is needed. -/
