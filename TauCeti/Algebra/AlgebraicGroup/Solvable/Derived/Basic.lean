# Solvability and the derived closed subgroup

Let `H` be a commutative Hopf algebra. Its derived closed subgroup has coordinate algebra
`H / CommHopfAlgCat.derivedDefiningIdeal H`. This file proves, over any commutative base and at
every commutative value algebra, that the point group of `H` is solvable exactly when the point
group of any closed subgroup containing the derived subgroup is solvable. The derived-subgroup
and geometric-points statements are immediate specializations.

One implication is closure of solvability under closed subgroups. Conversely, the derived closed
subgroup contains every pointwise commutator, so the corresponding point-group quotient is
commutative. Solvability of the derived subgroup and of this commutative quotient then gives
solvability of the ambient point group by extension closure. No equality between the abstract
pointwise commutator subgroup and the points of the derived group is needed.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.CommHopfAlgCat.isSolvable_points_iff_of_le_derivedDefiningIdeal`: over any
  commutative base and value algebra, the point group is solvable exactly when any closed subgroup
  containing the derived subgroup has a solvable point group.
* `TauCeti.CommHopfAlgCat.isSolvable_points_iff_derived`: the derived-subgroup specialization.
* `TauCeti.geometricallySolvablePointsCommHopfAlgProperty_iff_derived`: geometric-point
  solvability is equivalent to geometric-point solvability of the derived closed subgroup.

This comparison passes solvability between a geometric group and its derived subgroup, and is used
when reducing arguments by derived length.
