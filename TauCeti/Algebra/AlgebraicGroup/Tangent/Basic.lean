# The tangent space at the identity point

For a bialgebra `A` over `R`, the identity `B`-point of the functor of points is the
counit followed by the structure map — the unit of the convolution
monoid whenever the latter exists. This file packages `B` as an `A`-algebra through that point
(`Bialgebra.CounitAlgebra`), so that the dual-number dictionary
`TauCeti.derivationToDualNumberEquivLift` applies verbatim: derivations of `A` at the
identity point are the dual-number points lying over the identity
(the dictionary applied at `Bialgebra.CounitAlgebra`).

For `A` a Hopf algebra and `B` commutative, the dual-number points form a convolution
group, reduction of the infinitesimal part is a group homomorphism
(`dualNumberReduction`), and its kernel `tangentKer` is multiplicatively equivalent to
the additive monoid of derivations at the identity
(`derivationMulEquivTangentKer`); in particular the kernel is a commutative group
(the `CommGroup (tangentKer R A B)` instance).

This identifies counit-valued derivations with the first-order infinitesimal kernel.
The additive wrapper of the kernel inherits its natural `B`-module structure through this
identification, and `derivationLinearEquivTangentKer` records the resulting linear equivalence.
No Lie bracket or functoriality in `B` is constructed here — first-order commutativity of the
kernel says nothing about the Lie bracket, which appears at second order.

The synonym `CounitAlgebra` is a fresh scope for the point-induced algebra structure,
as the dictionary requires; it does not install instances on `B` itself, and
`Bialgebra.CounitAlgebra.algEquivSelf` transports back to `B` as an `R`-algebra.
An algebra homomorphism between coefficient algebras transports these synonyms via
`Bialgebra.CounitAlgebra.mapAlgHom`; `Bialgebra.CounitAlgebra.map` records that this
transport is linear for the actions induced by the counit.

The general generator criterion `Derivation.apply_eq_zero_of_mem_span` says that a
counit-valued derivation vanishing on counit-zero generators vanishes on their ideal span.

## The exterior convolution product

This file *applies* the exterior convolution product `LinearMap.mulTensor` — two
convolution linear maps applied legwise on `A ⊗[R] A` and multiplied in the coefficients
— to counit-valued derivations. The product itself, together with its normalization rules
(zero, addition, scalars) and its multiplicativity for convolution, is defined generically
in `TauCeti/Algebra/Coalgebra/Convolution.lean`. Composing with the multiplication of `A` lands in
this product's image: an algebra-map point satisfies `g ∘ mul = g ⊠ g`
(`AlgHom.toConv_toLinearMap_comp_mul'`), and a counit-valued derivation satisfies the
Leibniz rule `d ∘ mul = 1 ⊠ d + d ⊠ 1` (`Derivation.toConv_coe_comp_mul'`). This
calculus lives here, at the tangent level, because every later structure on the tangent
space — the Lie bracket and the adjoint action alike — is a composition-level
consequence of these three identities.
