# Functoriality of the derived subgroup

A homomorphism of affine group schemes carries commutators to commutators, and therefore
restricts to a homomorphism of their derived closed subgroup schemes. In coordinate Hopf
algebras, a morphism `f : H ⟶ K` sends the ideal defining the derived subgroup of `Spec H`
into the ideal defining the derived subgroup of `Spec K`. It consequently induces a morphism

```text
H / derivedDefiningIdeal H ⟶ K / derivedDefiningIdeal K.
```

Using the naturality of the commutator coordinate morphism, this file constructs the induced
quotient morphism and packages its identity and composition laws as an endofunctor on commutative
Hopf algebras. Applying `Spec` reverses this map to the expected restriction between derived
subgroup schemes.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.CommHopfAlgCat.derivedDefiningIdeal_map_le`: the derived defining ideals are
  functorial.
* `TauCeti.CommHopfAlgCat.derivedMap`: the induced morphism on derived coordinate algebras.
* `TauCeti.CommHopfAlgCat.derivedFunctor`: the derived coordinate algebra as an endofunctor.
* `TauCeti.CommHopfAlgCat.derivedQuotientNatTrans`: the ambient quotient maps as a natural
  transformation to the derived-coordinate functor.

## References

* J. S. Milne, *Algebraic Groups* (2017), §6d, especially Proposition 6.17.
* W. C. Waterhouse, *Introduction to Affine Group Schemes*, Chapter 10.

This supplies the functoriality part of the derived-group target `G_der` in Layer 6,
"Reductive and semisimple groups", of the ReductiveGroups roadmap.
