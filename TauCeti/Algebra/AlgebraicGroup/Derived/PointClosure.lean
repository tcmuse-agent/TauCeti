# Derived subgroups of closures of point subgroups

The derived closed subgroup of the reduced closure of a rational-point subgroup `S` is the
reduced closure of `⁅S, S⁆`. This holds over any field: the points of `S` separate functions
on their own closure, and their pairs therefore separate its tensor square. In particular,
this comparison can be iterated along the abstract derived series.

For a reduced finite-type affine group over an algebraically closed field, specializing to
all rational points identifies the derived defining ideal with the vanishing ideal of the
abstract commutator subgroup. Thus the all-points comparison is a specialization of the
subgroup-closure comparison.

If the rational points of the ambient group have finite derived length, then commutators of
closures lie in the closure of the commutator
(`TauCeti.HopfIdeal.commutator_quotientPointsSubgroup_vanishingIdeal_le`), so the rational points
of the derived subgroup have strictly smaller derived length. This is the measure the Lie--Kolchin
induction decreases.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.CommHopfAlgCat.derivedDefiningIdeal_eq_vanishingIdeal_commutator`: the derived
  subgroup is the closure of the abstract commutator subgroup of rational points.
* `TauCeti.CommHopfAlgCat.derivedSeries_points_derived_eq_bot`: if the rational points have
  derived length at most `n + 1`, those of the derived subgroup have derived length at most `n`.
