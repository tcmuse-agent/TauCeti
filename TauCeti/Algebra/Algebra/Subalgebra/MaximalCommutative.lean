# Commutative subalgebras of maximal dimension

Let `A` be a finite-dimensional algebra over a field `K`. Dimensions of subalgebras of `A` are
bounded by `finrank K A`, so among the commutative subalgebras there is one of largest dimension,
and such a subalgebra is its own centralizer: an element commuting with all of it generates,
together with it, a commutative subalgebra, which maximal dimension forces to be it again.

Neither statement needs anything of `A` beyond finite-dimensionality. They become interesting in a
division algebra, where a commutative subalgebra of maximal dimension is a maximal subfield
(`TauCeti.Algebra.exists_subalgebra_isField_finrank_eq_deg` in
`TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/MaximalSubfield.lean`).

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_isMulCommutative_forall_finrank_le`: a finite-dimensional algebra has a
  commutative subalgebra of maximal dimension.
* `TauCeti.centralizer_eq_self_of_forall_finrank_le`: such a subalgebra is its own centralizer.

## Implementation notes

Commutativity of a subalgebra is Mathlib's `IsMulCommutative` on its coercion to a type, which is
what `Algebra.isMulCommutative_adjoin` produces, rather than a hand-rolled
`∀ x ∈ L, ∀ y ∈ L, x * y = y * x`; `setLike_mul_comm` is the lemma that reads the second off the
first.

Maximality is in dimension over `K`, stated as a bound on every commutative subalgebra, and not as
maximality for inclusion; the two agree here, but the dimension form is what the count in a central
simple algebra consumes.

/-- **A finite-dimensional algebra has a commutative subalgebra of maximal dimension.**

Maximality is in dimension over `K` and is stated as a bound on every commutative subalgebra of
`A`, not as maximality for inclusion.

No hypothesis beyond finite-dimensionality is needed; it is in a division algebra that such a
subalgebra becomes interesting
(`TauCeti.Algebra.exists_subalgebra_isField_finrank_eq_deg`). -/

/-- **A commutative subalgebra of maximal dimension is its own centralizer.**

Maximality enters as the hypothesis `hmax`, the dimension bound over all commutative subalgebras
of `A` that `TauCeti.exists_isMulCommutative_forall_finrank_le` produces.

Nothing beyond finite-dimensionality is asked of `A`; it is in a division algebra that the
conclusion becomes the maximality of a subfield
(`TauCeti.Algebra.exists_subalgebra_isField_finrank_eq_deg`). -/
