# Separating subgroups of a linearly ordered group

A subgroup strictly contained in another is separated from it by an element of prescribed sign:
`Δ < Γ'` admits a member of `Γ'` outside `Δ` that exceeds `1`, and dually one below `1`. Nothing
beyond a group, a linear order and inversion reversing strict order is assumed.

That the witness has a *strict* sign is what these are for. A monotone map out of `Γ` carries a
bound only to `≤`; a witness of this shape is what upgrades such a bound to the strict inequality
a cofinality argument needs.

## Main results

* `Subgroup.exists_one_lt_of_lt` and `Subgroup.exists_lt_one_of_lt` : the two orientations of the
  separation statement.

## References

* T. Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*, arXiv:1910.05934v1, §1.4 — the convex-subgroup and cofinality
  material these lemmas serve, in particular Definition 1.16 and Corollary 1.21.
