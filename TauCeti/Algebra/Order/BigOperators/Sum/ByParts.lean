# Comparing weighted sums through their partial sums

If every initial partial sum of `f` is at most the corresponding partial sum of `g`, then the
same comparison holds after weighting both sequences by a nonnegative, antitone weight `w`:
`∑_{i < N} w i * f i ≤ ∑_{i < N} w i * g i`. This is Abel's inequality in its comparison form.
Summation by parts (`Finset.sum_range_by_parts`) writes the difference of the two weighted sums
as the last weight times the last partial-sum difference plus the successive decrements of `w`
times the earlier partial-sum differences, and every one of these products is nonnegative.

No sign condition on `f` or `g` is needed. The typical use takes `g` constant: a bound
`∑_{i < k} f i ≤ k • C` on all partial sums then gives `∑ w i * f i ≤ (∑ w i) * C` for every
nonnegative antitone weight.

/-- **Abel's inequality, comparison form.** If the partial sums of `f` are dominated by those of
`g` up to `N`, and `w` is nonnegative and antitone on the first `N` indices, then
`∑_{i < N} w i * f i ≤ ∑_{i < N} w i * g i`. Only the last weight is required
to be nonnegative explicitly; the other signs follow from the successive comparisons
when `N > 0`. -/
