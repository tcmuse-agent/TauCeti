# The radicals of `gl n K` and `sl n K`

`TauCeti/Algebra/Lie/GeneralLinear/Basic.lean` identifies the centre of `gl n R` (the scalar
matrices) and its derived ideal (`sl n R`), and shows that the two are complementary submodules as
soon as the size of the matrices is invertible. This file proves the reductivity criterion itself,
Mathlib's `LieAlgebra.HasCentralRadical`: over a field in which `2 ≠ 0`, the solvable radical of
`gl n K` **is** its centre. That is the third clause of the concrete `gl n` structure statement of
the highest-weight roadmap, and it is what makes the reductive vocabulary applicable to `gl n`,
whose Killing form is degenerate.

The same structure shows that `sl n K` has trivial radical when `2` and the nonempty matrix size
are nonzero. In characteristic zero this is registered as an instance, so Cartan's criterion makes
the Killing-form API available by typeclass synthesis.

The proof is the structure of the Lie ideals of `gl n K`. The centre is always an abelian, hence
solvable, ideal, so it is contained in the radical. For the other inclusion, every solvable ideal
must consist of scalar matrices, and that is a consequence of the sharper statement
`TauCeti.slIdeal_le_of_notMem_center`: **a Lie ideal containing a single non-central matrix already
contains all of `sl n K`**. Since `sl n K` is perfect (`TauCeti.lie_slIdeal_slIdeal`) and nonzero as
soon as there are two indices, it is not solvable, so no solvable ideal reaches outside the centre.

The ideal-generation argument runs through matrix units, and only two brackets are needed.
Bracketing against a diagonal matrix rescales a matrix unit,
`⁅diagonal d, Eₚq c⁆ = Eₚq ((dₚ - d_q) c)` (`TauCeti.lie_single_of_mem_diagonalCartan`, from the
diagonal Cartan subalgebra file), which extracts `Eₚq` from any diagonal element separating the
indices `p` and `q`. Bracketing twice against `Eⱼᵢ` annihilates everything except one entry,
`(ad Eⱼᵢ)² x = Eⱼᵢ (-2 xᵢⱼ)` (`TauCeti.lie_single_lie_single_self`), which extracts `Eⱼᵢ` from any
element with a nonzero `(i, j)` entry. A non-central matrix is either non-diagonal, and then the
second bracket applies, or diagonal with two distinct entries, and then the first does. Once one
off-diagonal matrix unit lies in the ideal, so does the difference of diagonal units
`E_bb - Eₐₐ = ⁅E_bₐ, Eₐb⁆`, which separates `b` from every other index; that produces every unit in
the row and the column of `b`, then every difference of diagonal units, and finally, by the first
bracket again, all the remaining units.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.lie_single_self_sub_single_self_single` and `TauCeti.lie_single_lie_single_self`: the
  bracket computations that produce matrix units inside a Lie ideal.
* `TauCeti.slIdeal_le_of_notMem_center`: **a Lie ideal of `gl n K` containing a non-central matrix
  contains `sl n K`**; equivalently `TauCeti.slIdeal_le_or_le_center`, every Lie ideal of `gl n K`
  either contains `sl n K` or consists of scalar matrices.
* `TauCeti.lie_slIdeal_slIdeal`: **`sl n R` is perfect**, `⁅sl n R, sl n R⁆ = sl n R`, whenever `2`
  is invertible in `R`, whence `TauCeti.not_isSolvable_slIdeal`: it is not solvable when `R` is
  nontrivial and there are at least two indices.
* `TauCeti.radical_matrix_eq_center` and `TauCeti.hasCentralRadical_matrix`: **`gl n K` is
  reductive**, its radical being its centre.
* `TauCeti.hasTrivialRadical_sl`: **`sl n K` has trivial radical** when `2` and the nonempty
  matrix size are nonzero; the characteristic-zero case is a named instance.

## Implementation notes

The hypothesis `(2 : K) ≠ 0` is genuinely needed, and not an artefact of the bracket computations:
in `gl 2 (ZMod 2)` the span of `E₁₂` and the identity matrix is a Lie ideal containing a non-central
element but not `E₂₁`, and there `sl 2 (ZMod 2)` is nilpotent, so it is a solvable ideal strictly
larger than the centre. No invertibility of the size of the matrices is needed, however: the
statement is proved uniformly in the index type, the case of at most one index being the abelian
one, where the radical and the centre are both everything.

Only the results about ideals are stated over a field, because the generation argument divides by an
arbitrary nonzero matrix entry. The two bracket identities need only a commutative ring, and
perfectness of `sl n R` — which divides by `2` alone — is stated over a commutative ring in which
`2` is a unit, non-solvability adding only `Nontrivial R`; the radical computation specialises these
to a field.

The bracket against a diagonal matrix is not recomputed here: a diagonal matrix lies in the diagonal
Cartan subalgebra of `TauCeti/Algebra/Lie/GeneralLinear/DiagonalCartan.lean`, so the eigenvector
computation `TauCeti.lie_single_of_mem_diagonalCartan` of that file supplies it, and a difference of
diagonal matrix units is turned into a diagonal matrix by `Matrix.diagonal_single` and
`Matrix.diagonal_sub`.

/-- **The special linear Lie algebra has trivial radical.** If `2` and, for nonempty `n`, the
cardinality of `n` are nonzero, a solvable ideal of `sl n` maps to a solvable ideal of `gl n`,
hence lies in the scalar matrices. Its image also lies in the complementary derived ideal `sl n`,
so the original ideal vanishes. -/
