# Field-valued points of the type A full-weight carrier

This file proves that over a field the matrix points of the full-weight type `A_r` carrier are
exactly `SL_{r+1}`. The ring-general transvection generation step is proved in
`TauCeti.Algebra.Lie.SpecialLinear.StandardCarrier.Generation`; Mathlib's generation of special
linear groups by transvections then gives the result.

The result is the reverse, on field-valued points, of the determinant-one containment proved in
`TauCeti.Algebra.Lie.SpecialLinear.StandardCarrier.DeterminantOne`. It is a pointwise generation
step toward identifying the integral carrier group scheme with the special linear group scheme;
the equality of their defining Hopf ideals over `ℤ` is not asserted here.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.SlStd.toGL_mem_points`: every determinant-one matrix over a field is a point of the
  carrier.
* `TauCeti.SlStd.mem_points_iff_det_eq_one`: over a field, carrier-point membership is equivalent
  to having determinant one.
* `TauCeti.SlStd.points_eq_range_toGL`: over a field, the carrier points are exactly the image of
  `SL_{r+1}` in `GL_{r+1}`.

## References

This advances Layer 9, "The Chevalley--Demazure construction", of
`TauCetiRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`: it proves the missing generation statement for the
explicit full-weight type `A` carrier on points over fields.
