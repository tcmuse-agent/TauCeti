# Integral points of the type A full-weight carrier

This file identifies the integral matrix points of the full-weight type `A_r` carrier with the
image of `SL_{r+1}(ℤ)`. It applies the ring-general carrier generation theorem to the existing
generation of the integral special linear group by transvections.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.SlStd.points_int_eq_range_toGL`: the integral carrier points are exactly the image of
  `SL_{r+1}(ℤ)` in `GL_{r+1}(ℤ)`.
* `TauCeti.SlStd.mem_points_int_iff_det_eq_one`: integral carrier-point membership is equivalent
  to having determinant one.

This advances Layer 9, "The Chevalley--Demazure construction", of
`TauCetiRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`: it records the integral-points consequence of the
ring-general generation statement for the explicit full-weight type `A` carrier.
