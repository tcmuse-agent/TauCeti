# The enveloping algebra of an abelian Lie algebra is its symmetric algebra

Let `L` be an abelian Lie algebra over a commutative ring `R`, that is, one whose bracket vanishes
identically (`IsLieAbelian L`). This file proves that the canonical map
`ι : L → UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra R L` exhibits `U(L)` as the **symmetric algebra** of the
`R`-module `L`, and reads off the resulting basis of `U(L)`.

## What this says

The defining relation of `U(L)` is `ι x * ι y - ι y * ι x = ι ⁅x, y⁆`, so for an abelian `L` it is
the commutativity relation and nothing else: `U(L)` is commutative
(`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.instCommRing`), and it is the *universal* commutative
`R`-algebra containing `L`, which is the symmetric algebra. Both algebras are therefore built by
the same universal property, and the comparison is the pair of lifts in either direction; nothing
finer, and in particular no Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt input, is used.

The consequence that is not visible in the universal property is the **basis**. The symmetric
algebra of a free module is a polynomial algebra (Mathlib's
`SymmetricAlgebra.equivMvPolynomial`), so for a basis `b` of `L` the algebra `U(L)` is the
polynomial algebra on the `b i` (`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.mvPolynomialEquiv`) and the
monomials `∏ᵢ ι(b i) ^ nᵢ` are an `R`-basis of it
(`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.basisMonomials`). That is the Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt
ordered-monomial theorem for an abelian Lie algebra: the ordering of a monomial carries no
information here, since the generators commute, so a monomial is recorded by its exponent
function `n : κ →₀ ℕ` rather than by a sorted word.

One ring-theoretic finiteness property transfers across the comparison with no further Lie theory:
`U(L)` is a **domain** over a domain when `L` is free as a module
(`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.instIsDomain`), being a polynomial algebra. That instance is
the abelian case of a general Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt corollary, which over a field holds for every
Lie algebra; the general statement goes through the associated graded of the PBW filtration and is
not proved here, the argument below using commutativity of `U(L)`
throughout.

The comparison also makes `ι` injective on any abelian `L`
(`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.ι_injective`), with no hypothesis on `L` as a module: it
identifies `ι` with the canonical map `L → S(L)`, which the square-zero extension `R ⊕ L` retracts.
For a general Lie algebra injectivity is instead a corollary of Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt, which
over a commutative ring needs `L` to be free (or at least projective) as an `R`-module, and is
unconditional only over a field.

## Where it is used

A Cartan subalgebra `H` of a Lie algebra `L` with non-degenerate Killing form is abelian, by
Mathlib's `LieAlgebra.IsKilling.instIsLieAbelianOfIsCartanSubalgebra`; that instance also asks that
`L` be free and finite as an `R`-module, that `R` be an integral domain and a principal ideal ring,
and that `L` be Artinian, all of which hold for a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field.
`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.symmetricAlgebraEquiv` then applies to `H` with no hypotheses
of its own beyond that abelianness, and identifies `U(H)` with `S(H)`. This identification is what
the Harish-Chandra projection of Layer 7 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md` is stated against, and the abelian
case of the ordered-monomial basis of the Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt sub-project of Layer 3, whose
spanning half is
`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.span_orderedPBWMonomials_eq_pbwFiltration`. The general theorem
is not proved here: the argument below uses commutativity of `U(L)` throughout and says nothing
about a non-abelian `L`.
