# The bar coderivation of the coaugmented tensor coalgebra

`TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.barDifferential` is the square-zero coderivation of the *reduced* tensor
coalgebra, and the Stasheff identities are read off from it.  The module and bimodule theories
need one step more: a right module is a coderivation over `b` on the cofree right bar comodule, and
a bimodule a bicomodule coderivation, so in both cases `b` has to be available as a coderivation
of the *coaugmented* tensor coalgebra, which also carries the empty word.

This file supplies that extension, for the bar differential of an `A∞` algebra.  The empty word is
annihilated, and on the coaugmented tensor coalgebra the extension is a
`TauCeti.TensorWords.IsGradedCoderivation` of twist parameter one whose square is zero and which
raises the total letter degree by one.

The extension itself is not specific to bar constructions: an endomorphism of the reduced words is
extended to all tensor words by
`TauCeti.TensorWords.extendReduced`, and the module
`TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.TensorCoalgebra.Coaugmented.Extension` proves there that the extension
preserves the square-zero law, the homogeneity in the total letter degree, and the `q`-twisted
co-Leibniz identity.  The results of this file are the applications of those three lemmas to
`TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.barDifferential`, together with the empty-word case; the coaugmented
co-Leibniz identity itself, the letterwise maps, and the total-letter-degree pieces are in
`TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.TensorCoalgebra.Coaugmented.GradedCoderivation` and
`TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.TensorCoalgebra.Coaugmented.Basic`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.coaugmentedBarDifferential`: the bar coderivation extended to all
  tensor words by zero on the empty word.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.coaugmentedBarDifferential_one`: the extension annihilates the empty
  word.
* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.coaugmentedBarDifferential_comp_reducedInclusion`: the extension
  restricts to the bar differential on the words of positive length.
* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.coaugmentedBarDifferential_sq`: its square is zero.
* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.isHomogeneous_coaugmentedBarDifferential`: it raises the total letter
  degree by one.
* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.isGradedCoderivation_coaugmentedBarDifferential`: it is a
  twist-parameter-one graded coderivation of the coaugmented tensor coalgebra.
