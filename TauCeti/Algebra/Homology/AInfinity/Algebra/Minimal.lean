# Minimal A∞ algebras

An A∞ algebra is minimal when its unary operation vanishes. Every element is then a cycle and
there are no nonzero boundaries, giving a linear equivalence with its cohomology. Between minimal
algebras, a morphism is a quasi-isomorphism exactly when its linear part is bijective.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.IsMinimal`: the unary operation vanishes.
* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.IsMinimal.cohomologyEquiv`: identification with cohomology.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.isMinimal_iff_cycles_eq_top` and
  `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.isMinimal_iff_boundaries_eq_bot`: minimality in terms of cycles and
  boundaries.
* `TauCeti.IsNonUnitalDGAlgebra.isMinimal_toAInfinityAlgebra_iff`: the `A∞` algebra of a DG
  algebra is minimal exactly when the differential vanishes.
* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.isMinimal_cohomologyAInfinityAlgebra`: the cohomology `A∞` algebra is
  minimal.
* `TauCeti.AInfinityHom.isQuasiIso_iff_linearPart_bijective`: between minimal algebras, a
  quasi-isomorphism has bijective linear part.
