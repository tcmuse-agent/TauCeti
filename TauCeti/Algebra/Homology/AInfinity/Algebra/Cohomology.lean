# Cohomology of an `A∞` algebra

The unary operation of an `A∞` algebra squares to zero, so it has cycles, boundaries, and a total
cohomology module.  The arity-two Stasheff identity is the graded Leibniz rule for the binary
operation, which therefore descends to a bilinear product on cohomology.

The Leibniz sign depends only on the degree of the left factor.  With a cycle on the right it
disappears, so a boundary times a cycle is a boundary.  With a cycle on the left it is removed by
the degree-one Koszul twist, which carries cycles to cycles, so a cycle times a boundary is a
boundary as well.  Neither argument needs homogeneous inputs.

The arbitrary-input arity-three identity `AInfinityAlgebra.m_one_m_three` exhibits the associator
of the binary operation as a unary boundary, so the induced product is associative on cohomology.
Together with bilinearity, this makes the cohomology an associative nonunital `R`-algebra.

The unary operation has degree one, so it commutes with the homogeneous projections up to a shift
of the degree by one.  Hence the homogeneous components of a cycle are cycles, and the degree-`p`
component of a boundary `m₁(y)` is the boundary `m₁(y_{p-1})`.  The cycles therefore inherit the
internal grading, the boundaries form a homogeneous submodule of them, and the cohomology is
graded by the classes of homogeneous cycles.  The binary operation has degree zero, so the
cohomology is a graded nonunital algebra: the graded algebra `H(A)` which carries the minimal
models of `A` and against which formality of `A` is measured.  As a graded nonunital algebra with
zero differential it is itself an `A∞` algebra, with zero `m₁`, the cohomology product as `m₂`,
and no higher operations; degree-preserving algebra morphisms between cohomology algebras are
strict morphisms of these `A∞` algebras.

## Main definitions

  boundaries of the unary operation.

* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.cohomologyClass`: the class represented by a cycle.
* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.cohomologyEquivOfCyclesEqTop`: the class-map equivalence when all
  elements are cycles.
* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.cohomologyMul`: the product on cohomology induced by the binary
  operation.
* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.instNonUnitalRingCohomology`, together with the scalar tower and
  commuting-scalars instances: the cohomology as an associative nonunital `R`-algebra.
* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.cyclesGrading`: the internal grading of the cycles.
* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.cohomologyGrading`: the internal grading of the cohomology by the
  classes of homogeneous cycles.
* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.cohomologyAInfinityAlgebra`: the cohomology as an `A∞` algebra whose
  only nonzero operation is `m₂`.

## Main results

  cycles.
