# Formal `A∞` algebras

The cohomology `H(A)` of an `A∞` algebra `A` is a graded nonunital algebra, hence an `A∞`
algebra with zero `m₁`, the cohomology product as `m₂`, and no higher operations; this is
`AInfinityAlgebra.cohomologyAInfinityAlgebra`, and it is minimal.  The algebra `A` is *formal*
when it admits an `A∞` quasi-isomorphism to this `A∞` algebra.  Over a field every `A∞`
quasi-isomorphism has an `A∞` inverse up to homotopy, so there the direction of the
quasi-isomorphism is immaterial.
Minimal models are exactly what distinguishes the two notions: a minimal algebra is identified
with its cohomology as a graded algebra via `m₂`, while formality additionally asks that its higher
operations can be removed up to quasi-isomorphism.

Formality is reflected along quasi-isomorphisms: if `A ⟶ B` is a quasi-isomorphism and `B` is
formal, then so is `A`, because a quasi-isomorphism identifies the two cohomology algebras
compatibly with their gradings.  A minimal algebra whose operations above arity two vanish is
formal, since the class map is then a strict isomorphism onto its cohomology; in particular a
graded nonunital algebra with zero differential is formal.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.IsFormal`: existence of an `A∞` quasi-isomorphism to
  `cohomologyAInfinityAlgebra`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.IsMinimal.isFormal`: a minimal algebra with vanishing higher operations
  is formal. `TauCeti.IsNonUnitalDGAlgebra.isFormal_toAInfinityAlgebra_of_differential_eq_zero`
  applies this to DG algebras with zero differential.
* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.IsFormal.of_isQuasiIso`: formality is reflected along
  quasi-isomorphisms.
