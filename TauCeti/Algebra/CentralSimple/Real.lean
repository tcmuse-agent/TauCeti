# Frobenius' theorem: the real central division algebras are `ℝ` and `ℍ[ℝ]`

A finite-dimensional division algebra over `ℝ` whose centre is `ℝ` is `ℝ`-isomorphic either to `ℝ`
itself or to the Hamilton quaternions `ℍ[ℝ]`. This is the classification the Brauer group of `ℝ`
needs: it says that the two Brauer classes already known -- the identity and the class of `ℍ[ℝ]` --
are all there are.

The proof runs in three steps, and only the first uses anything about central simple algebras.

*The degree is at most two.* A central division algebra has a subfield of degree `deg ℝ D`
(`TauCeti.Algebra.exists_subalgebra_isField_finrank_eq_deg`), and a finite extension of `ℝ` is `ℝ`
or `ℂ` (Mathlib's `Real.nonempty_algEquiv_or`), so that degree is `1` or `2` and `finrank ℝ D` is
`1` or `4`.

*Every element satisfies a real quadratic.* For `y : D` the subalgebra `ℝ[y]` is commutative and
finite-dimensional over `ℝ`, hence a field, hence `ℝ` or `ℂ` again; in either case `y * y` is a real
combination of `1` and `y` (`TauCeti.exists_mul_self_eq_algebraMap_add_smul`). Completing the square
and rescaling turn any `y` outside `ℝ` into an `i` with `i * i = -1`
(`TauCeti.exists_mul_self_eq_neg_one`).

*A second imaginary unit anticommutes with the first.* Centrality gives an `x` not commuting with
`i`, and then `j = x + i * x * i` satisfies `i * j = i * x - x * i = -(j * i)`, so it is nonzero and
anticommutes with `i`. Anticommutation forces `j * j` to be a real scalar, necessarily negative
because a nonnegative one would factor in the division ring `D` and put `j` in `ℝ`; rescaling `j`
makes `j * j = -1`. The pair `(i, j)` is a `QuaternionAlgebra.Basis`, so `ℍ[ℝ]` maps to `D`, and the
map is injective because `ℍ[ℝ]` is a division ring and surjective because both sides have
dimension `4`.

Beyond the degree bound no maximal subfield, centralizer theorem or Skolem-Noether argument is
needed; the rest is the elementary Frobenius argument.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_mul_self_eq_algebraMap_add_smul`: every element of a finite-dimensional real
  algebra that is a domain satisfies a monic real quadratic.
* `TauCeti.exists_mul_self_eq_neg_one`: such an algebra other than `ℝ` contains a square root
  of `-1`.
* `TauCeti.exists_mul_self_eq_neg_one_and_mul_eq_neg_mul`: a square root of `-1` that is not
  central has an anticommuting partner, again a square root of `-1`.
* `TauCeti.Algebra.deg_le_two`: **a real central division algebra has degree at most `2`.**
* `TauCeti.nonempty_algEquiv_quaternion_of_finrank_eq_four`: a four-dimensional real central
  division algebra is `ℍ[ℝ]`.
* `TauCeti.nonempty_algEquiv_real_or_quaternion`: **Frobenius' theorem**, a real central division
  algebra is `ℝ` or `ℍ[ℝ]`.

## Implementation notes

Mathlib's `NormedAlgebra.Real.exists_isMonicOfDegree_two_and_aeval_eq_zero` is the same quadratic
relation, but it is stated for an element of a normed `ℝ`-algebra whose norm is multiplicative.
That hypothesis is not available here, `D` carrying no norm; the relation is therefore reproved
from the finite-dimensionality of `ℝ[y]`.

The three quadratic lemmas are stated for a domain rather than a division ring: no inverse in `D`
is ever taken, only inverses of real scalars, so `[Ring D] [IsDomain D]` is what the arguments
use. The division algebras of Frobenius' theorem supply those instances.

if `i * i = -1` and some `x` fails to commute with `i`, then there is a `j` with `j * j = -1` and
`i * j = -(j * i)`.

The partner is built from `x` as follows. The element `j₀ = x + i * x * i` satisfies
`i * j₀ = i * x - x * i = -(j₀ * i)`, so it is nonzero and anticommutes with `i`. Its square
commutes with `i`, so in the quadratic `j₀ * j₀ = a + b * j₀` the linear coefficient `b` must
vanish, `i * j₀` being nonzero. So `j₀ * j₀` is a real scalar while `j₀` itself is not, `j₀` being a
scalar only if it commuted with `i`; `exists_smul_mul_self_eq_neg_one` then rescales `j₀` to a
