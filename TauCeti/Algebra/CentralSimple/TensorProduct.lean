# Central simple algebras are closed under tensor product

Let `K` be a field, let `A` be a central simple `K`-algebra and let `B` be a simple `K`-algebra.
This file proves that `A ⊗[K] B` is again simple, in both orientations. Together with
`TauCeti.Algebra.IsCentral.tensorProduct` of `TauCeti/Algebra/Central/TensorProduct.lean`, which
says that `A ⊗[K] B` is again central as soon as `B` is, this is the statement that central simple
`K`-algebras are closed under `⊗[K]`. That closure is what lets the tensor product descend to a
multiplication on Brauer classes.

Simplicity needs no finite-dimensionality. The argument is the classical minimal-length one, and it
uses only that `A` is simple with centre `K` and that `B` is simple.

Simplicity is a statement about `A ⊗[K] B` as a ring, so it applies unchanged to a scalar extension
`L ⊗[K] A` along a field extension `L / K`, with `L` merely simple and `A` central simple: that is
the orientation supplied by `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.tensorProduct_of_isCentral_right`. It is only the
simplicity half of "`L ⊗[K] A` is central simple over `L`". The centrality there is a statement
about `L ⊗[K] A` as an `L`-algebra, over `L` and not over `K`, and is not proved here:
`TauCeti.Algebra.IsCentral.tensorProduct` gives centrality over `K` and asks both factors to be
central over `K`, which for a nontrivial extension `L / K` the factor `L` is not. The other half is
`TauCeti.Algebra.IsCentral.baseChange` in `TauCeti/Algebra/Central/BaseChange.lean`, which asks only
that `A` be central and `L` be free as a `K`-module, and so combines with the simplicity instance
below rather than resting on it.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.tensorProduct`: `A ⊗[K] B` is simple when `A` is central simple and `B` is
  simple. Only one of the two factors has to be central.
* `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.tensorProduct_of_isCentral_right`: the mirror-image statement, with `B`
  central simple and `A` merely simple, obtained by transporting the previous one along
  `Algebra.TensorProduct.comm`. This is the orientation of a scalar extension `L ⊗[K] A`.

Both are instances, and `TauCeti.Algebra.IsCentral.tensorProduct` is re-exported by this module, so
importing this file alone lets typeclass inference recognize `A ⊗[K] B` as a central simple
`K`-algebra whenever `A` and `B` are. With Mathlib's matrix instances that reads
`Mₘ(K) ⊗[K] Mₙ(K)` off with no glue; that is the worked example checked at the end of the file.

## Implementation notes

The minimal-length argument for simplicity is run in the coordinates of
`Algebra.TensorProduct.basis A 𝓑`, the `A`-basis of `A ⊗[K] B` attached to a `K`-basis `𝓑` of `B`.
Reading an element in these coordinates is exactly the classical step "write `x = ∑ aᵢ ⊗ bᵢ` with
the `bᵢ` linearly independent over `K`", with the Finsupp support playing the role of the length of
that expression. Multiplying by `a ⊗ₜ 1` on one side multiplies every coordinate on that same side,
which is what makes the coordinatewise bookkeeping of that argument -- the two-sided ideal of
`i₀`-th coordinates, and the support of an additive commutator -- available. On the left this is
just the generic scalar-action API: `(a ⊗ₜ 1) * x` is the module action `a • x` by Mathlib's
`smul_one_mul` (packaged as `Algebra.TensorProduct.tmul_one_mul_eq_smul`), and
`(Algebra.TensorProduct.basis A 𝓑).repr` is `A`-linear. The right-hand version is a statement in
its own right, `Algebra.TensorProduct.basis_repr_mul_tmul_one`, and it is where it matters that the
coordinates are taken with respect to a basis of `B` over the *base* field: that is what lets the
scalars pass through `a`. Both are general facts about `A ⊗[K] B` and live in
`TauCeti/Algebra/TensorProduct/Mul.lean`.

Simplicity is then the classical minimal-length argument: given a nonzero two-sided ideal
`I`, pick a nonzero `y ∈ I` with as few nonzero coordinates as possible; after rescaling one
coordinate to `1` (which is where simplicity of `A` is used), minimality forces every additive
commutator `(a ⊗ₜ 1) * y - y * (a ⊗ₜ 1)` to vanish, so `y = 1 ⊗ₜ b` by
`TauCeti.Algebra.TensorProduct.forall_commute_tmul_one_iff`; simplicity of `B` then pushes `1`
into `I`.

Both appeals to simplicity in `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.tensorProduct` are made by exhibiting a
two-sided ideal that is nonzero, hence everything: on the `A` side the `i₀`-th coordinates of the
elements of a two-sided ideal `I` supported in a fixed finite set, built as a `TwoSidedIdeal.mk'`,
and on the `B` side the `c : B` with `1 ⊗ₜ c ∈ I`, which is `I.comap` along
`Algebra.TensorProduct.includeRight`. That is how `1` enters `I`; phrasing the argument this way
avoids ever expanding `1` as an explicit sum `∑ uⱼ a vⱼ`.

Layer 4 of the
[semisimple algebras roadmap](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCetiRoadmap/blob/main/TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/SemisimpleAlgebras/README.md).
That bullet also asks for `finrank K (A ⊗ B) = finrank K A * finrank K B`, which needs nothing new
here: it is Mathlib's `Module.finrank_tensorProduct`, applicable to `A ⊗[K] B` as it stands. See
