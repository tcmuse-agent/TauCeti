# The centralizer of a central simple subalgebra

Let `K` be a field, let `A` be a finite-dimensional **simple** `K`-algebra and let `B ⊆ A` be a
**central simple** `K`-subalgebra. The centralizer theorem says that

  `C = C_A(B) = {c : A | c commutes with every element of B}`

is again a simple `K`-algebra, and that its dimension is the complementary one:

  `finrank K B * finrank K C = finrank K A`.

The dimension formula is sharpened here to a decomposition: multiplication `B ⊗[K] C → A` is an
algebra isomorphism, because its source is simple, so that the map is injective, and the two sides
have the same dimension. When `A` is moreover **central** simple, the decomposition forces `C` to be
central as well, since a tensor product of algebras over a field is central only if both factors
are; so `C` is central simple in turn, the centralizer theorem applies to it, and comparing the two
dimension formulas gives the **double centralizer** `C_A(C) = B`.

The proof is the module-theoretic one, and it reuses the bimodule of the Skolem-Noether theorem. The
inclusion `B.val : B →ₐ[K] A` makes `A` a module over `R = B ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ`
(`TauCeti.Bimodule`), with `b ⊗ₜ op a` acting by `x ↦ b * x * a`. Because `B` is central simple and
`Aᵐᵒᵖ` is simple, `R` is a simple ring (`TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.tensorProduct`), finite-dimensional
over `K`. Now an `R`-linear endomorphism of `A` is in particular linear for the right action of `A`,
hence is multiplication on the left by some `c : A`, and its linearity for the left action of `B` is
exactly the statement that `c` commutes with `B`. So

  `C ≃ₐ[K] End_R A`,

and both conclusions are read off the general facts about the endomorphism algebra of a module over
a simple Artinian algebra proved in `TauCeti/RingTheory/Semisimple/EndAlgebra.lean`: such an algebra
is simple, and `finrank K (End_R A) * finrank K R = (finrank K A)²`. Since
`finrank K R = finrank K B * finrank K A`, dividing by `finrank K A` leaves the dimension formula.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.centralizerAlgEquivEnd`: the identification `C_A(B) ≃ₐ[K] End_{B ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ} A`, by left
  multiplication. It needs no hypothesis beyond `B` being a subalgebra.
* `TauCeti.centralizer_isSimpleRing`: **the centralizer of a central simple subalgebra is simple.**
* `TauCeti.finrank_mul_finrank_centralizer`: **the centralizer theorem**,
  `finrank K B * finrank K C_A(B) = finrank K A`.
* `TauCeti.finrank_mul_finrank_centralizer_of_isField`: the same dimension formula for a
  **subfield** of a central simple algebra, where centrality is asked of the ambient algebra
  instead of the subalgebra.
* `TauCeti.tensorCentralizerAlgEquiv`: **the tensor decomposition** `B ⊗[K] C_A(B) ≃ₐ[K] A`, by
  multiplication.
* `TauCeti.centralizer_isCentral`: **the centralizer of a central simple subalgebra of a central
  simple algebra is central**, so that `C_A(B)` is central simple again.
* `TauCeti.centralizer_centralizer`: **the double centralizer theorem**, `C_A(C_A(B)) = B`.
* `TauCeti.deg_mul_deg_centralizer`: the degree form of the dimension formula,
  `deg K B * deg K C_A(B) = deg K A`.

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.centralizerAlgEquivEnd` is stated for an arbitrary subalgebra `B` of an arbitrary
`K`-algebra `A` over a commutative semiring `K`: neither simplicity nor finite-dimensionality nor
the field structure plays any part in identifying the endomorphism algebra, they enter only when
that algebra is analysed. Keeping the two apart is what makes the identification reusable, for
instance for the double centralizer. The equivalence is characterised on both sides, by
`TauCeti.centralizerAlgEquivEnd_apply` and `TauCeti.centralizerAlgEquivEnd_symm_apply`, and the
algebra homomorphism and bijectivity proof it is assembled from are private to this file.

Centrality is asked of `B` and not of `A`, exactly as in
`TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/SkolemNoether.lean`, and for the same reason: what the proof needs is
that `B ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ` is simple, which `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.tensorProduct` gets from `B` central
simple and `A` simple. The roadmap's central simple form is the case `Algebra.IsCentral K A`, which
these statements cover. Centrality of `B` cannot be dropped: for `K = ℝ`, `A = ℂ` and `B = A`, the
centralizer is all of `ℂ`, so `finrank ℝ B * finrank ℝ C = 4 ≠ 2 = finrank ℝ A`; the worked example
at the end of the file records this.

Because simplicity of `B ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ` is all the dimension formula uses, the count itself is proved
once and separately, in
`TauCeti.finrank_mul_finrank_centralizer_of_isSimpleRing_tensorProduct_mulOpposite`;
`TauCeti.finrank_mul_finrank_centralizer` is the case of it where that simplicity comes from `B`
central simple and `A` simple, and `TauCeti.finrank_mul_finrank_centralizer_of_isField` the case
where it comes instead from `B` a subfield of a central simple `A`.

That last statement asks for `IsField ↥L` and not for the weaker `IsSimpleRing ↥L`, which is all
its proof uses. The restriction is a scope boundary and not a mathematical one: stated for a merely
simple subalgebra it is the centralizer theorem for a non-central simple subalgebra, which the
Layer 5 bullet of the roadmap referenced below defers — "the general form for a merely simple
subalgebra `B` (center `Z(B) ⊋ K`) ... is a **later** target, not this one" — to be taken up
together with the description of the centralizer's centre. Nothing is lost in generality by it:
the count itself is stated at the level its proof works at, and a caller with a merely simple `L`
can use it directly.

Centrality of `A`, on the other hand, is asked only of the last three statements, and there it
cannot be dropped either: for `K = ℝ`, `A = ℂ` and `B = ⊥`, which is central simple, the centralizer
of `B` is all of `ℂ` and so is its centralizer in turn, which is not `⊥`. The second worked example
records this.

`TauCeti.deg_mul_deg_centralizer` is stated here rather than beside the other degree lemmas in
`TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/Degree.lean`, so that the degree file stays free of the centralizer
machinery: it is a statement about a centralizer, whose only degree input is
`TauCeti.Algebra.deg_tensorProduct`.

### Centrality of the centralizer, and the double centralizer

The three statements below need `A` itself to be **central** simple, and not merely simple. This is
the first point in the file where that is so: the dimension formula and the tensor decomposition
hold over `K` without assuming that `A` is central, but `C_A(C_A(B)) = B` genuinely fails when `A`
has a larger center, as the second worked example at the end of the file records.

/-- **The centralizer of a central simple subalgebra of a central simple algebra is central.**
Together with `TauCeti.centralizer_isSimpleRing` this says that `C_A(B)` is again central simple, so
that the centralizer theorem may be applied to it in turn.

The proof is the tensor decomposition `B ⊗[K] C_A(B) ≃ₐ[K] A` transported: the tensor product is
central because `A` is, and a tensor product of algebras over a field is central only if each factor
is, provided the other one is nontrivial (`Algebra.IsCentral.right_of_tensor_of_field`); here `B` is
nontrivial because it is simple. -/

/-- **The double centralizer theorem for a central simple subalgebra.** For a central simple
`K`-subalgebra `B` of a finite-dimensional central simple `K`-algebra `A`,

  `C_A(C_A(B)) = B`.

One inclusion is formal. For the other, `C = C_A(B)` is itself central simple
(`TauCeti.centralizer_isSimpleRing` and `TauCeti.centralizer_isCentral`), so the centralizer theorem
applies to `C` as well and gives `finrank K C * finrank K C_A(C) = finrank K A`, while for `B` it
gives `finrank K B * finrank K C = finrank K A`. Cancelling `finrank K C`, which is positive, leaves
`finrank K C_A(C) = finrank K B`, and a subalgebra containing `B` with the dimension of `B` is `B`.

The inner centralizer is written as the `Set.centralizer` of `↑B`, which is what
`Subalgebra.coe_centralizer` (a `simp` lemma) turns the coerced subalgebra into, so that the
left-hand side is in simp normal form; `Subalgebra.centralizer_centralizer_centralizer` is stated
the same way. -/

/-- **The degree is multiplicative along a central simple subalgebra**:
`deg K B * deg K C_A(B) = deg K A`.

This is the dimension formula with square roots taken, the degree being the square root of the
dimension (`TauCeti.Algebra.deg_sq`), and it is the shape in which the centralizer theorem is
usually quoted. It is a statement about the degree of `C_A(B)`, so it needs `C_A(B)` to be
central simple, which is `TauCeti.centralizer_isCentral` together with
`TauCeti.centralizer_isSimpleRing`; given that, it is the tensor decomposition read through
`TauCeti.Algebra.deg_tensorProduct`. -/

/-- The negative control for `TauCeti.finrank_mul_finrank_centralizer`: centrality of the subalgebra
cannot be dropped. Take `K = ℝ` and `A = B = ℂ`, a simple finite-dimensional `ℝ`-algebra which is
**not** central over `ℝ`. Its centralizer is all of `ℂ`, so the two sides of the dimension formula
are `2 * 2` and `2`. -/

/-- The negative control for `TauCeti.centralizer_centralizer`: centrality of the **ambient**
algebra cannot be dropped. Take `K = ℝ` and `A = ℂ` again, and `B = ⊥`, which is central simple,
being `ℝ` itself. Its centralizer is all of `ℂ`, and so is the centralizer of that, not `⊥`. -/
example :
    Subalgebra.centralizer ℝ
        (Subalgebra.centralizer ℝ ((⊥ : Subalgebra ℝ ℂ) : Set ℂ) : Set ℂ)
      ≠ (⊥ : Subalgebra ℝ ℂ) := by
  -- `⊥` consists of scalars, so it lies in the center of `ℂ`, and its centralizer is everything.
  have hbot : Subalgebra.centralizer ℝ ((⊥ : Subalgebra ℝ ℂ) : Set ℂ) = ⊤ :=
