# Wedderburn-Artin for central simple algebras

Mathlib's `IsSimpleRing.exists_algEquiv_matrix_divisionRing_finite` writes a finite-dimensional
simple `K`-algebra `A` as a matrix algebra `Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) D` over a division algebra `D`,
but it says nothing about the centre of `D`: the theorem is about simplicity alone. For the theory
of central simple algebras one needs the refinement in which `D` is again **central** over `K`,
because that is the hypothesis every later structure theorem (the degree, Skolem-Noether, the Brauer
group) carries.

This file supplies the missing step. Feeding Mathlib's Wedderburn-Artin theorem the centrality
descent `TauCeti.isCentral_of_isCentral_matrix` gives `A ≃ₐ[K] Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) D` with `D` a
central division algebra, together with the dimension count `finrank K A = n ^ 2 * finrank K D`.

The same file settles the finite base field. A finite division ring is a field (little Wedderburn),
so `Algebra.IsCentral.baseField_essentially_unique` collapses a finite central division algebra to
its base field, and every central simple algebra over a finite field is a full matrix algebra
`Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) K`. In particular its dimension is the square `n ^ 2`. Centrality is what
makes this work: `𝔽_{q^m}` is a finite division algebra over `𝔽_q` which is *not* the base field,
the failure being exactly that its structure map is not surjective.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.exists_algEquiv_matrix_centralDivisionRing`: **Wedderburn-Artin for central
  simple algebras**. A finite-dimensional central simple `K`-algebra `A` is
  `Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) D` for a finite-dimensional **central** division `K`-algebra `D`, and
  `finrank K A = n ^ 2 * finrank K D`.
* `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.exists_algEquiv_matrix_of_forall_nonempty_algEquiv`: over a field whose
  finite-dimensional central division algebras are all the field itself, every
  finite-dimensional central simple algebra is a full matrix algebra over that field. It is the
  criterion behind `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.exists_algEquiv_matrix_of_finite` below and
  `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.exists_algEquiv_matrix_of_isSepClosed` in
  `TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/SeparablyClosed.lean`.
* `TauCeti.baseFieldAlgEquivOfFinite`: a finite central division algebra over a field is the base
  field.
* `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.exists_algEquiv_matrix_of_finite`: a central simple algebra over a
  **finite** field is a full matrix algebra over that field, so in particular its dimension is the
  perfect square `n ^ 2`. That dimension count holds over every base field, by
  `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.isSquare_finrank` in `TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/Degree.lean`, which is
  the statement to use; only the matrix presentation itself is special to a finite field.

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.baseFieldAlgEquivOfFinite` assumes `Finite D`, the single hypothesis little Wedderburn
needs, rather than the pair `Finite K` and `FiniteDimensional K D`; the two are equivalent, because
`K` embeds in `D`. The central-simple corollary does take the pair `Finite K` and
`FiniteDimensional K A`, which is how a finite base field is met in practice.

Uniqueness of the pair `(n, D)` is *not* proved here; it needs the invariance of the Wedderburn
data, which is a separate development.

/-- **A field whose central division algebras are all itself splits every central simple
algebra.** Given the Wedderburn presentation `A ≃ₐ Mₙ(D)`, the hypothesis collapses `D` to `K`.

The hypothesis says that `K` admits no finite-dimensional central division algebra other than
itself, equivalently that its Brauer group is trivial. It holds over a finite field, by little
Wedderburn, and over a separably closed field, where Jacobson--Noether would otherwise produce a
separable element outside the base field. -/

A finite division ring is a field by little Wedderburn (the instance `littleWedderburn`), so `K → D`
is a central extension of fields and `Algebra.IsCentral.baseField_essentially_unique` applied to the
tower `D / D / K` makes it bijective. Centrality is essential: `𝔽_{q^m}` is a finite division
algebra over `𝔽_q` whose structure map is not surjective for `m > 1`. -/

/-- **A central simple algebra over a finite field is a full matrix algebra.** Over a finite field
the only finite-dimensional central division algebra is the field itself, so the division algebra in
the Wedderburn presentation collapses and `finrank K A = n ^ 2`.

This is the finite-field analogue of Mathlib's
`IsSimpleRing.exists_algEquiv_matrix_of_isAlgClosed`; note that `IsSimpleRing A` alone would not
suffice, since `A` could be a proper field extension of `K`. -/
