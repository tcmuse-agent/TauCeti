# Preadditive structure on finitely generated comodules

This file makes the preadditive structure on the category of finitely generated right
comodules over a coalgebra over a commutative ring available from a finite-comodule import.
The category is a full subcategory of all comodules, so Mathlib transfers the preadditive
structure from `ComoduleCat`. The forgetful functor to `ModuleCat R` is additive.

It also records concrete simp lemmas computing the zero, addition, negation, and subtraction of
finitely generated comodule morphisms through the underlying ambient comodule morphism `.hom`,
and pointwise on elements, so downstream code never has to unfold the full-subcategory transfer.

This is a small Layer 1 prerequisite for the reductive-groups roadmap's finite-dimensional
representation category: additive hom-sets are needed before tensor products, duals, and
Tannakian reconstruction can be built on finitely generated comodules.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.FGComoduleCat.hom_zero`, `hom_add`, `hom_neg`, `hom_sub`: the additive-group
  operations on finitely generated comodule morphisms agree with those of the ambient
  `ComoduleCat` morphism underneath.
* `TauCeti.FGComoduleCat.zero_apply`, `add_apply`, `neg_apply`, `sub_apply`: the same
  operations computed pointwise on elements.

## References

This supplies additive-category bookkeeping for
`ReductiveGroups/README.md` in TauCetiRoadmap, Layer 1 target "Comodules over a coalgebra/Hopf
algebra": the finite-dimensional comodule category should have additive hom-sets before the
rigid monoidal representation category is developed. The transfer mechanism is Mathlib's
`ObjectProperty.FullSubcategory` preadditive instance.
