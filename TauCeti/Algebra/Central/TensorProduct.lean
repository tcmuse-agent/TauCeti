# The tensor product of two central algebras is central

Mathlib's `Mathlib/Algebra/Central/TensorProduct.lean` has the two *converse* statements
(`Algebra.IsCentral.left_of_tensor_of_field` and `Algebra.IsCentral.right_of_tensor_of_field`), but
not the forward one. This file supplies it, over a field, together with the elementwise centralizer
computation it rests on.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Algebra.TensorProduct.forall_commute_tmul_one_iff`: for `A` central over `K`, the
  centralizer of `A ⊗ 1` in `A ⊗[K] B` is exactly `1 ⊗ B`. This is Mathlib's
  `Subalgebra.centralizer_coe_range_includeLeft_eq_center_tensorProduct` specialized to
  `Z(A) = K` and phrased elementwise. It is stated over a commutative base ring with `B` free, the
  hypotheses that theorem needs; the case of a field is picked up by typeclass inference.
* `TauCeti.Algebra.IsCentral.tensorProduct`: `A ⊗[K] B` is central when both factors are.

The companion simplicity statement, `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.tensorProduct`, is in
`TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/TensorProduct.lean`; together the two say that central simple
`K`-algebras are closed under `⊗[K]`. That closure is what lets the tensor product descend to a
multiplication on Brauer classes. Note that the centrality proved here is centrality over the base
field `K`: for a scalar extension `L ⊗[K] A` along a field extension `L / K` the statement wanted is
centrality over `L`, which is a different statement, proved as
`TauCeti.Algebra.IsCentral.baseChange` in `TauCeti/Algebra/Central/BaseChange.lean`.

/-- **The centralizer of `A ⊗ 1` in `A ⊗[K] B` is `1 ⊗ B`**, for `A` a central `K`-algebra and `B`
free: an element of `A ⊗[K] B` commutes with every `a ⊗ₜ 1` exactly when it is of the form
`1 ⊗ₜ b`.

This is Mathlib's `Subalgebra.centralizer_coe_range_includeLeft_eq_center_tensorProduct`, which
computes that centralizer as `Z(A) ⊗ B`, specialized to `Z(A) = K` and repackaged as a statement
about elements. Centrality of `A` is what shrinks the centralizer to `1 ⊗ B`; without it `Z(A) ⊗ B`
can be strictly larger. -/
