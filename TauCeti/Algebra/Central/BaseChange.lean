# Base change preserves and detects centrality

Let `A` be a central algebra over a field `K` and let `L / K` be a field extension. This file proves
that the scalar extension `L ⊗[K] A` is central *over `L`*, and conversely that centrality of
`L ⊗[K] A` over `L` forces centrality of `A` over `K`.

This is a genuinely different statement from the centrality over `K` proved in
`TauCeti/Algebra/Central/TensorProduct.lean`: that one asks both factors to be central over `K`, and
for a nontrivial extension the factor `L` is not.

The proof is short once the centralizer computation is available. The centre of `L ⊗[K] A` is
contained in the centralizer of `1 ⊗ A`, which is `L ⊗ 1` because `A` is central over `K`; and
`L ⊗ 1` is exactly the image of `L`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Algebra.IsCentral.baseChange`: **`L ⊗[K] A` is central over `L`** when `A` is central
  over `K` and `L` is a commutative `K`-algebra free as a `K`-module. It is an instance, so
  together with `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.tensorProduct_of_isCentral_right` instance search sees
  `L ⊗[K] A` as a central simple `L`-algebra with no glue.
* `TauCeti.Algebra.IsCentral.of_baseChange`: the converse over a field `K`, so centrality is not
  merely preserved by base change but **detected** by it.
* `TauCeti.Algebra.isCentral_baseChange_iff`: the two packaged as an equivalence.

Central *simplicity* of a scalar extension, its degree, and the compatibility of base change with
`⊗` and `ᵐᵒᵖ` are assembled from these in `TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/BaseChange.lean`.

## Implementation notes

The forward direction is stated over a commutative semiring `K` and a commutative `K`-algebra `L`
that is free as a `K`-module, the hypotheses the centralizer computation
`TauCeti.Algebra.TensorProduct.forall_commute_tmul_one_iff` needs; a field extension is the case of
interest and satisfies them. The converse genuinely needs `K` to be a field: it splits off a
`K`-linear retraction `L → K` of the structure map, which is where the vector-space hypothesis
enters, and `L` need only be a nontrivial commutative `K`-algebra.

Both directions are about the `L`-algebra structure on `L ⊗[K] A` coming from the left factor, which
is Mathlib's `Algebra.TensorProduct.leftAlgebra`.

/-- **Base change preserves centrality.** If `A` is a central `K`-algebra and `L` is a commutative
`K`-algebra which is free as a `K`-module, then the scalar extension `L ⊗[K] A` is central over
`L`.

Freeness of `L` and centrality of `A` are both used, through the centralizer computation
`TauCeti.Algebra.TensorProduct.forall_commute_tmul_one_iff`: an element of `L ⊗[K] A` commuting with
every `1 ⊗ₜ a` is of the form `l ⊗ₜ 1`, that is, a scalar. Centrality of `A` cannot be dropped, and
`ℂ ⊗[ℝ] ℂ` is the standard witness. -/

/-- **Base change detects centrality.** Over a field `K`, if the scalar extension `L ⊗[K] A` is
central over a nontrivial commutative `K`-algebra `L`, then `A` was already central over `K`.

The centre of `A` lands in the centre of `L ⊗[K] A` under `a ↦ 1 ⊗ₜ a`, so a central `a` satisfies
`1 ⊗ₜ a = l ⊗ₜ 1` for some `l : L`. Applying `L ⊗[K] A → A` built from a `K`-linear retraction of
`K → L` turns that identity into `a = g l • 1`. -/
