# Existence of projective covers over a semiprimary ring

`TauCeti/Algebra/Module/ProjectiveCover/Basic.lean` develops the projective cover of a module as a
*given* datum: it is unique, and it receives every projective presentation, but nothing there
produces one. This file supplies the existence theorem. Over a **semiprimary** ring — Mathlib's
`IsSemiprimaryRing`, a ring whose Jacobson radical is nilpotent and whose radical quotient is
semisimple, as a finite-dimensional algebra over a field is — **every** module has a projective
cover (`TauCeti.exists_isProjectiveCover`), with no finiteness hypothesis on the module.

Some hypothesis on the ring is genuinely needed: `ℤ ⧸ 2ℤ` has no projective cover as a `ℤ`-module,
although it has finite length.

## The construction

Write `J` for the radical and `M ↦ M ⧸ J • M` for passage to the radical quotient. Fix a free
module `N` with a surjection `p : N ↠ M` — the free module on the underlying set of `M` will do —
and let `q : N ⧸ J • N ↠ M ⧸ J • M` be the induced surjection. The cover is cut out of `N` by an
idempotent, in three steps.

* **The radical quotient is semisimple.** `N ⧸ J • N` is a module over `R ⧸ J`, which is a
  semisimple ring, so it is a semisimple `R ⧸ J`-module and hence a semisimple `R`-module
  (`TauCeti.isSemisimpleModule_quotient_jacobson_smul_top`). Therefore `ker q` has a complement
  `C`, and the projection onto `C` along `ker q` is an idempotent `ē` of `End (N ⧸ J • N)` with
  `range ē = C`.
* **The idempotent lifts.** Reduction of endomorphisms modulo `J • N` is a ring homomorphism
  `Ideal.endMapQ J N : End N →+* End (N ⧸ J • N)`. It is surjective because `N` is projective
  (`Ideal.endMapQ_surjective`), and every element of its kernel is nilpotent because `J` is
  (`Ideal.isNilpotent_of_mem_ker_endMapQ`): a map with image inside `J • N` has `k`-th power with
  image inside `J ^ k • N`. Mathlib's `exists_isIdempotentElem_eq_of_ker_isNilpotent` therefore
  lifts `ē` to an idempotent `e` of `End N`.
* **The cover is the image of the lift.** `P = range e` is a direct summand of the free module `N`,
  so it is projective, and `π = p|_P` is the cover. It is onto because its image spans `M` modulo
  `J • M` — that is what `ker ē = ker q` says — and `J • M` is superfluous
  (`TauCeti.isSuperfluous_smul_top_of_isNilpotent`, Nakayama for a nilpotent ideal). Its kernel is
  superfluous because an element of it reduces into `C ⊓ ker q = ⊥`, hence lies in `J • N`, hence,
  being fixed by `e`, lies in `J • P`.

Nilpotence of `J` is used twice, and differently: once to make `J • M` superfluous in an arbitrary
module — which is what removes every finiteness hypothesis, and is why a semiprimary ring covers
*all* modules and not only the finitely generated ones a semiperfect ring covers — and once to make
the kernel of the reduction map nil, which is what lets the idempotent lift.

Semiperfectness itself is `TauCeti.IsSemiperfectRing`, in
`TauCeti/RingTheory/Jacobson/Semiperfect.lean`: the second use of nilpotence above, made at the
level of the ring rather than of `End N`, is exactly the statement that a semiprimary ring is
semiperfect.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.exists_isProjectiveCover_comp_subtype`: over a semiprimary ring, a surjection onto `M`
  from a projective module restricts to a projective cover of `M` on a submodule of its source.
* `TauCeti.exists_isProjectiveCover`: **every module over a semiprimary ring has a projective
  cover**, carried by a submodule of the free module on its underlying set.
* `TauCeti.exists_isProjectiveCover_of_finite`: the same statement for a module over a ring that is
  finite over an Artinian ring, such as a finite-dimensional algebra over a field; such a ring is
  semiprimary.
