# Projective covers in `ModuleCat`

`TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover` is the module-level predicate — a surjection from a projective module
with superfluous kernel — and `TauCeti.IsEssentialEpi` is its categorical counterpart, an
epimorphism `π` such that every morphism `g` into its source with `g ≫ π` an epimorphism is itself
one. This file is the bridge between the two over `ModuleCat`: a linear map that is a projective
cover is an essential epimorphism of `ModuleCat` from a projective object, and conversely
(`TauCeti.isProjectiveCover_iff_projective_and_isEssentialEpi`), so the existence theorem of
`TauCeti/Algebra/Module/ProjectiveCover/Existence.lean` reads as a statement about objects of
`ModuleCat`.

The two translations used are Mathlib's: an epimorphism of `ModuleCat` is a surjection
(`ModuleCat.epi_iff_surjective`), and a projective object of `ModuleCat` is a projective module
(`IsProjective.iff_projective`). The module-level content of essentiality is
`TauCeti.isProjectiveCover_iff_forall_surjective`.

The covering module produced here is a submodule of a free module on the underlying set of the
module covered, so it lives in the same universe as that module; this is why the statements below
fix a single universe for the ring and the category.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.isEssentialEpi`: a module-level projective cover is an essential
  epimorphism of `ModuleCat`.
* `TauCeti.isProjectiveCover_iff_projective_and_isEssentialEpi`: the two readings agree — a
  morphism of `ModuleCat` is a projective cover of modules exactly when its source is a projective
  object and it is an essential epimorphism.
* `TauCeti.exists_essentialEpi_projective`: **every object of `ModuleCat R` over a semiprimary ring
  receives an essential epimorphism from a projective object.**
* `TauCeti.exists_projectiveCover`: the same for a module over a ring finite over an Artinian ring,
  such as a finite-dimensional algebra over a field, with the two clauses of essentiality written
  out.

`ModuleCat`: surjectivity is `Epi` and the minimality of a superfluous kernel is exactly the
essentiality clause, by `TauCeti.isProjectiveCover_iff_forall_surjective`. -/

/-- **The two readings of a projective cover agree.** A morphism of `ModuleCat` is a projective
cover of modules exactly when its source is a projective object and it is an essential
epimorphism. The backward direction recovers the module-level API — surjectivity and a superfluous
kernel — from the categorical data: a map into the source is tested through its range, a submodule
of the source and so again an object of `ModuleCat`. -/

/-- **Every object of `ModuleCat R` over a semiprimary ring has a projective cover**: it receives
an essential epimorphism from a projective object. Unfolding `TauCeti.IsEssentialEpi`, this says
that `π` is an epimorphism and that every `i : X ⟶ P` with `i ≫ π` an epimorphism is one. -/

finiteness is required of the module. Essentiality is spelled out here as its two clauses, so that
the statement is usable without unfolding `TauCeti.IsEssentialEpi`. -/
