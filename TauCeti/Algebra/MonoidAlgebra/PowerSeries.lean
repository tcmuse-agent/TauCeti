# Power series over a monoid algebra

For a commutative semiring `R`, an `R`-algebra `A` and a monoid `M`, the monoid algebra of `M`
over the power-series ring `A⟦X⟧` maps to the power-series ring over the monoid algebra `A[M]` by
collecting, for each `n`, the coefficients of `Xⁿ` of the monomial coefficients:

```text
∑ₘ φₘ · m  ↦  ∑ₙ (∑ₘ (coeff n φₘ) · m) Xⁿ.
```

This is an `R`-algebra homomorphism `MonoidAlgebra.toPowerSeries`, characterised by
`coeff_coeff_toPowerSeries`: the coefficient at `m` of the coefficient of `Xⁿ` of the image is
the coefficient of `Xⁿ` of the coefficient at `m` of the argument. It is always injective, and
for a finite monoid `M` it is an isomorphism `MonoidAlgebra.powerSeriesAlgEquiv`. For an
infinite `M` and a nontrivial `A` it is not surjective: a power series whose coefficients are
supported on infinitely many elements of `M` altogether is not in the image, since an element of
`A⟦X⟧[M]` involves only finitely many elements of `M`.

The finite case writes the ring `ℤ_p⟦X⟧[C]` attached to a finite group `C` as the power-series
ring `ℤ_p[C]⟦X⟧` over the group ring `ℤ_p[C]`; this is how the completed group algebra of a
product `C × ℤ_p` becomes a power-series ring over `ℤ_p[C]`.

## Main declarations

* `MonoidAlgebra.toPowerSeries R A M`: the `R`-algebra homomorphism
  `A⟦X⟧[M] →ₐ[R] A[M]⟦X⟧`, with `coeff_coeff_toPowerSeries` and `toPowerSeries_injective`.
* `MonoidAlgebra.powerSeriesAlgEquiv R A M`: the isomorphism `A⟦X⟧[M] ≃ₐ[R] A[M]⟦X⟧`
  for finite `M`.
