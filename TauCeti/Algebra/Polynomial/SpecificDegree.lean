# Polynomials of small degree

Splitting criteria for low-degree polynomials and a separability criterion, all read off the
coefficients.

* Away from characteristic two, a cubic that already has one root splits exactly when its
  discriminant is a square: the root splits off a quadratic factor whose discriminant differs from
  that of the cubic by a square, and a quadratic splits exactly when its discriminant is a square.
  Normalization by the leading coefficient reduces the statement to the monic case.
* A cubic with two distinct roots in its coefficient field splits there, and conversely a
  separable split polynomial of degree at least two has two distinct roots.
* An irreducible polynomial is separable as soon as its degree is nonzero in the coefficient
  field, which for a quartic is exactly what characteristic `≠ 2` gives.
* A monic quadratic `X² + aX + b` divides a depressed quartic `X⁴ + pX² + qX + r` exactly when
  the two coefficients of the remainder of the division vanish. Over `ℤ` this reduces the search
  for a quadratic factor of an explicit quartic to two Diophantine equations, which a reduction
  modulo a small prime can rule out. The analogous criterion for `X⁵ + cX + d` supports
  finite-field irreducibility tests for quintics.

Together these turn the single test "the resolvent cubic of a quartic has a root in the base
field" into the classical resolvent conditions — irreducible, splits completely, exactly one root
— used by the quartic label table of `TauCeti.FieldTheory.GaloisGroups.Quartic.Basic`.

## Main results

* `Polynomial.Irreducible.separable_of_natDegree_cast_ne_zero` and
  `Polynomial.separable_of_irreducible_of_natDegree_eq_four`
* `Polynomial.exists_natDegree_eq_two_of_natDegree_eq_three_of_isRoot`
* `Polynomial.splits_iff_isSquare_discr_of_natDegree_eq_two` and
  `Polynomial.splits_iff_isSquare_discr_of_natDegree_eq_three_of_isRoot`
* `Polynomial.Splits.of_natDegree_eq_three_of_isRoot_of_isRoot_of_ne` and
  `Polynomial.Splits.exists_isRoot_ne`
* `Polynomial.X_sq_add_C_mul_X_add_C_dvd_X_pow_four_add_iff`: when a monic quadratic divides a
  depressed quartic, by explicit division with remainder
* `Polynomial.X_sq_add_C_mul_X_add_C_dvd_X_pow_five_add_iff`: when a monic quadratic divides
  `X⁵ + cX + d`
