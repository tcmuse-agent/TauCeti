# Even and doubly-even binary codes

Binary Hamming weights detect Euclidean orthogonality: the dot product is the parity of the
intersection of supports, and the weight of a sum subtracts twice that intersection. Consequently,
a binary linear code whose weights are all divisible by four is self-orthogonal.

An even code is characterized by membership of the all-ones word in its dual. In particular,
a binary self-dual code is even and contains the all-ones word. These facts supply the elementary
parity constraints used in the study of doubly-even self-dual codes.

The conventions and weight-intersection argument follow Huffman and Pless,
*Fundamentals of Error-Correcting Codes*, Chapters 1 and 9.
