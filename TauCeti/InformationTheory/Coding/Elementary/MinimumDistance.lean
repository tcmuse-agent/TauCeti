# Minimum distance of repetition codes

Two distinct constant words differ in every coordinate, so over a nontrivial alphabet the
repetition code of length `n` has minimum distance `n`. The puncturing and shortening identities
used here are in `TauCeti.InformationTheory.Coding.Elementary.Operations`.

These computations test the hypotheses of the general minimum-distance bounds for coordinate
operations. The repetition code attains the deleted-coordinate bound for puncturing
(`TauCeti.hammingMinDist_le_hammingMinDist_puncture_add_card_compl`) with equality, and it shows
that the nonvanishing hypothesis in the shortening bound
(`TauCeti.hammingMinDist_le_hammingMinDist_shorten`) cannot be dropped. Already the binary
repetition code `{00, 11}` has minimum distance two, while retaining only its first coordinate
leaves the zero code, of minimum distance zero.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.hammingMinDist_repetitionCode`: the repetition code has minimum distance equal to its
  length.
* `TauCeti.hammingMinDist_puncture_repetitionCode_add_card_compl`: sharpness of the puncturing
  bound.
* `TauCeti.hammingMinDist_shorten_repetitionCode_lt`: shortening can decrease minimum distance
  once the shortened code collapses.
