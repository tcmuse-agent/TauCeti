# Consequences of the index formula

Adjoining the centre to a finite-index subgroup keeps the index finite, since it only enlarges
the subgroup.

Because the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group -- with the index as cofactor --
invertibility of the order of a finite group in a semiring passes to every subgroup.

Adjoining a two-element subgroup `N ⊄ Γ` normalised by `Γ` is also quantified: `Γ` then has
relative index exactly `2` in `Γ ⊔ N`, so `Γ.index = 2 * (Γ ⊔ N).index`. Taking `N` to be the
centre gives the `Γ.withCenter` readings.

## Main results

* `Subgroup.mem_withCenter_iff`: an element of `Γ·Z(G)` is one of `Γ` times a central one.
* `TauCeti.index_eq_of_natCard_eq_mul`: cancel a known nonzero subgroup order from the
  order-index formula.
* `Subgroup.withCenter_le_iff`: the universal property — containing `Γ·Z(G)` is containing both.
* `Subgroup.withCenter_eq_self_iff`: adjoining the centre changes nothing exactly when the
  centre already lies inside `Γ`.
* `Subgroup.relIndex_sup_eq_two`, `Subgroup.index_eq_two_mul_index_sup`: the relative index `2`
  and the index doubling, for an `N` normalised by `Γ` whose elements are `1` and `a ∉ Γ`.
* `Subgroup.instCountableQuotient`: a coset space of a countable group is countable.
* `Subgroup.finiteIndex_of_finiteIndex_subgroupOf`: finite index composes along `V ≤ U ≤ G`.
* `Subgroup.finiteIndex_inf_comap`: `H ⊓ f⁻¹(K)` has finite index when `H` does and
  `K` has finite index relative to `f(H)`.
* `Subgroup.finiteIndex_of_map_eq`: the image of a finite-index subgroup under a surjective
  homomorphism has finite index.
* `MonoidHom.finiteIndex_range_comp`: finite index of ranges is preserved by composition
  with a homomorphism of finite-index range.
* `MonoidHom.mk_mul_out_bijective`: right cosets of a composite range are represented by
  products of representatives for the two successive ranges.
* `Subgroup.relIndex_withCenter_eq_two`, `Subgroup.index_eq_two_mul_index_withCenter`: the same
  two facts on `Γ.withCenter`, when the centre is `{1, a}`.

/-- **A two-element subgroup normalised by `Γ` and not already inside it has relative index
`2`.** If every element of `N` is `1` or `a`, and `a ∉ Γ`, then `Γ ⊔ N` splits into the two
cosets `Γ` and `Γ * a`.

Only normalisation by `Γ` is asked for, not normality of `N` in the whole group, so a
two-element subgroup normalised by `Γ` alone is covered. A globally normal `N` is the special
case `Subgroup.le_normalizer_of_normal`.

Stated for an arbitrary `N` rather than for the centre, because the centre is often larger than
two elements — in `GL (Fin 2) ℝ` it is every scalar — while the two-element subgroup one actually
wants there is `Subgroup.zpowers (-1)`. A caller supplies whichever `N` is in hand.

`a` is not assumed to be an involution; it follows from the hypotheses that it is one.
