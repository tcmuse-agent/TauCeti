# The derived subgroup modulo its centre

Let `G` be a group. This file studies the group

```text
[G, G] / Z([G, G]),
```

the derived subgroup of `G` modulo the centre *of that derived subgroup*.

The construction is the last step of the standard recipe producing a finite group of Lie type: one
takes the fixed points `H` of a Steinberg endomorphism of a pinned algebraic group, passes to
`[H, H]`, and quotients by the centre of `[H, H]`. Taking the derived subgroup handles the
parameters at which `H` fails to be perfect, and the central quotient is what turns a quasisimple
group into a simple one. Everything in this file is carrier-independent: it needs only a group, so
it is available before any particular ambient group has been constructed.

Nothing here proves that the resulting group is finite or simple. What is proved is that the recipe
does nothing once it has succeeded: on a perfect group with trivial centre — in particular on any
nonabelian simple group — it returns the group itself, and by Grün's lemma its output is centreless
as soon as `[G, G]` is perfect, so a second application changes nothing.

Transport says that isomorphic groups have isomorphic derived central quotients, so the output
depends only on the isomorphism class of `G`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DerivedCentralQuotient`: the group `[G, G] / Z([G, G])`.
* `TauCeti.DerivedCentralQuotient.lift`: the factorisation of a surjection onto a centreless group.
* `TauCeti.DerivedCentralQuotient.congr`: transport of the derived central quotient along an
  isomorphism of groups, built from the transport `MulEquiv.commutatorCongr` of the derived
  subgroup.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DerivedCentralQuotient.mulEquivOfCenterEqBot`: a perfect group with trivial centre is its
  own derived central quotient.
* `TauCeti.DerivedCentralQuotient.mulEquivOfIsSimpleGroup`: so is a nonabelian simple group.
* `TauCeti.DerivedCentralQuotient.center_eq_bot`: the output is centreless when `[G, G]` is perfect,
  and `TauCeti.DerivedCentralQuotient.mulEquivSelf` then makes the construction idempotent.
* `TauCeti.DerivedCentralQuotient.subsingleton_iff`: the output is trivial exactly when `[G, G]` is
  commutative.

## References

This is the derived-subgroup-modulo-centre half of milestone L3 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`, which fixes the recipe `H = fixedSubgroup F` and
`Group = [H, H] / Z([H, H])` and the reading of the centre as the centre of the derived subgroup
rather than of `H`. The construction is standard; see R. W. Carter, *Simple Groups of Lie Type*,
and D. Gorenstein, R. Lyons and R. Solomon, *The Classification of the Finite Simple Groups*.
