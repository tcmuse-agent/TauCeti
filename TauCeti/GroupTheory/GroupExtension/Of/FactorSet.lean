# Group extensions built from a factor set

A *factor set* of a group `G` with values in a `G`-module `M` (written multiplicatively: `M` is a
commutative group carrying a `MulDistribMulAction` of `G`) is a normalized multiplicative
`2`-cocycle `α : G × G → M`. This file builds the group extension `1 → M → E_α → G → 1` it
determines: the underlying set is `M × G`, and the multiplication is the one of a semidirect
product twisted by `α`,

`⟨a, g⟩ * ⟨b, h⟩ = ⟨a * g • b * α (g, h), g * h⟩`.

The cocycle identity is exactly associativity of this product, and the normalization is exactly
what makes `⟨1, 1⟩` its identity, so both are carried as fields of `FactorSet` rather than as
hypotheses of the results below.

Two facts identify `α` as *the* factor set of the extension it builds. The set-theoretic section
`g ↦ ⟨1, g⟩` fails to be a homomorphism by exactly `α` (`TauCeti.FactorSet.canonicalSection_mul`),
and conjugating the copy of `M` inside the extension is the given action of `G` on `M`
(`TauCeti.FactorSet.mul_inl`). When `G` acts trivially the latter says the copy of `M` is central,
so the extension is a central extension; that is the case `M = kˣ` in which a projective
representation of `G` with factor set `α` becomes a linear representation of `E_α`.

A factor set is a multiplicative `2`-cocycle by definition, so no conversion is needed to reach
group cohomology: `groupCohomology.cocyclesOfIsMulCocycle₂ α.isMulCocycle₂` reads `α` as a
`2`-cocycle for the `ℤ`-linear representation of `G` on `Additive M`, the input to
`groupCohomology.H2`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.FactorSet G M`: a normalized multiplicative `2`-cocycle `G × G → M`, bundled with its
  cocycle and normalization proofs.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.Extension`: the twisted product `M × G` carrying the group structure above.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.groupExtension`: that group as a `GroupExtension M _ G`, i.e. together with
  the inclusion of `M`, the projection to `G`, and the exactness proofs.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.canonicalSection`: the section `g ↦ ⟨1, g⟩` of the projection.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.rescaleEquiv`: the equivalence of extensions obtained by rescaling that
  section.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.trivial`: the factor set that is constantly `1`.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.map`: the pushforward of a factor set along a `G`-equivariant homomorphism of
  coefficient modules.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.FactorSet.canonicalSection_mul`: `σ g * σ h = inl (α (g, h)) * σ (g * h)`, so `α`
  measures the failure of the canonical section to be a homomorphism, and
  `TauCeti.FactorSet.inl_mul_canonicalSection`: every element of the extension is its `M`-component
  times the section at its `G`-component, so the two together determine a homomorphism out of the
  extension.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.mul_inl`: conjugation moves the copy of `M` by the action of the image in `G`.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.inl_range_le_center`: when `G` acts trivially the extension is central.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.nonempty_groupExtensionEquiv`: cohomologous factor sets build equivalent
  extensions.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.trivialMulEquiv`: the extension attached to the trivial factor set is the
  semidirect product, and `TauCeti.FactorSet.trivialSplitting` splits it.
