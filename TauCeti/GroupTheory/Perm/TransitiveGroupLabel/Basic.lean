# Reference transitive permutation groups in degree at most five

This file defines the reference permutation groups underlying the standard `nTj` labels in
degrees at most five. A label records the ambient conjugacy class of a subgroup of the
symmetric group; it does not attach an abstract group name or classify arbitrary subgroups.

The chosen generators are the zero-based translations of the representatives in the LMFDB
transitive-groups table. The reference family is empty outside degrees one through five.

## Main definitions

* `numTransitiveGroups`: the number of reference groups in each supported degree.
* `TransitiveGroupIndex`: the type of valid zero-based label indices.
* `referenceSubgroup`: the subgroup represented by a valid index.
* `TransitiveGroupLabel`: conjugacy to a reference subgroup.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isPretransitive_referenceSubgroup`: every reference subgroup is transitive.
* `Subgroup.transitiveGroupLabel_map_permCongrHom_iff`: the label of a permutation group on an
  arbitrary set of `n` points does not depend on the numbering by `Fin n` used to read it.
* `TauCeti.TransitiveGroupLabel.exists_le_map_conj_of_le`: inclusion of a reference subgroup in
  a larger subgroup transports to inclusion of the labelled subgroup in a conjugate, and
  `TauCeti.TransitiveGroupLabel.exists_le_map_conj_iff`: a labelled subgroup lies in a conjugate
  of a fixed subgroup exactly when its reference subgroup does.
* `TauCeti.TransitiveGroupLabel.natCard_eq`, `TauCeti.TransitiveGroupLabel.le_alternatingGroup_iff`,
  `TauCeti.TransitiveGroupLabel.isPreprimitive_iff`, `TauCeti.TransitiveGroupLabel.isSolvable_iff`,
  `TauCeti.TransitiveGroupLabel.isCyclic_iff`:
  a labelled subgroup has the order, parity, primitivity, solvability, and cyclicity of its
  reference.
* `TauCeti.transitiveGroupLabel_one`, `TauCeti.transitiveGroupLabel_two_iff`: in degrees one and
  two, a subgroup carries the unique label exactly when it is transitive.
