# Transitive subgroups of `S₃`, `S₄` and `S₅`

This file classifies the transitive subgroups of the symmetric groups on three, four and five
points up to conjugacy: each of them is conjugate to exactly one of the reference subgroups of
`TauCeti.referenceSubgroup`, so it carries exactly one of the labels `3T1`, `3T2`, respectively
`4T1`, …, `4T5`, respectively `5T1`, …, `5T5`.

The existence half runs through the order of the subgroup. A transitive subgroup of
`Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` has order divisible by `n`, by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, and dividing
`n !`.

* In degree three the order is `3` or `6`. Order `6` is the whole group, and order `3` is index
  two, so it is the alternating group, which is the reference subgroup of `3T1`.
* In degree four the order is `4`, `8`, `12` or `24`. Order `24` is the whole group and order
  `12` is the alternating group, as in degree three. Order `8` is a Sylow `2`-subgroup, and so is
  the reference subgroup of `4T3`, so the two are conjugate by Sylow's theorem. Order `4` acts
  regularly: if the subgroup contains an element of order four, that element is a four-cycle,
  it generates the subgroup, and conjugating it onto `finRotate 4` gives `4T1`; otherwise every
  nontrivial element is a fixed-point-free involution, that is a double transposition, and the
  subgroup is the Klein four-group of `4T2`.
* In degree five the order is `5`, `10`, `20`, `60` or `120`
  (`TauCeti.natCard_mem_of_natCard_eq_five_of_isPretransitive`). Orders `120` and `60` are the
  whole group and the alternating group. A subgroup of order dividing `20` has a unique Sylow
  `5`-subgroup, so it lies in the normalizer of that subgroup; conjugating the Sylow subgroup
  onto the rotation group `5T1` carries the subgroup between `5T1` and its normalizer, the
  Frobenius group `5T3` of affine maps of `ℤ/5`. A subgroup of order `10` in between has index
  two in `5T3`, so it contains the square of every element of `5T3`, and in particular the
  square `i ↦ 3 - i` of `i ↦ 2 i + 1`, which generates `5T2` together with the rotation.

The uniqueness half compares invariants: the orders of the reference subgroups in each degree
are pairwise distinct, except for `4T1` and `4T2`, which have order four and are told apart by
parity, since `4T1` contains the odd permutation `finRotate 4`.

On the way, the orders of the reference subgroups of degrees three, four and five are computed,
the reference subgroup of `3T1` is identified with the alternating group, that of `4T3` with the
centralizer of the double transposition `finRotate 4 ^ 2`, and that of `5T3` with the normalizer
of the rotation group `5T1`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.natCard_referenceSubgroup_three_zero`, …, `TauCeti.natCard_referenceSubgroup_five_four`:
  the orders `3, 6`, `4, 4, 8, 12, 24` and `5, 10, 20, 60, 120` of the reference subgroups in
  degrees three, four and five.
* `TauCeti.isCyclic_referenceSubgroup_four_zero`, `TauCeti.not_isCyclic_referenceSubgroup_four_one`:
  the reference subgroup of `4T1` is cyclic and that of `4T2` is not.
* `TauCeti.index_referenceSubgroup_five_two`: the reference subgroup of `5T3` has index six.
* `TauCeti.referenceSubgroup_five_two_eq_normalizer_referenceSubgroup_five_zero`: the reference
  subgroup of `5T3` is the normalizer of that of `5T1`.
* `TauCeti.referenceSubgroup_three_zero_le_alternatingGroup`,
  `TauCeti.not_referenceSubgroup_three_one_le_alternatingGroup`: the parities of `3T1` and `3T2`,
  `TauCeti.referenceSubgroup_four_le_alternatingGroup_iff`: the parities of the five quartic labels,
  and `TauCeti.referenceSubgroup_five_le_alternatingGroup_iff`: the parities of the five quintic
  labels.
* `TauCeti.exists_le_map_conj_referenceSubgroup_four_two_iff`: a reference subgroup of degree four
  lies in a conjugate of the dihedral group of `4T3` exactly for the labels `4T1`, `4T2` and
  `4T3`.
* `TauCeti.TransitiveGroupLabel.eq_of_three`, `TauCeti.TransitiveGroupLabel.eq_of_four`,
  `TauCeti.TransitiveGroupLabel.eq_of_five`: in degrees three, four and five a subgroup carries
  at most one label.
* `TauCeti.existsUnique_transitiveGroupLabel_three`,
  `TauCeti.existsUnique_transitiveGroupLabel_four`,
  `TauCeti.existsUnique_transitiveGroupLabel_five`: a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group
  on three, four, respectively five, points carries exactly one label.
* `TauCeti.exists_transitiveGroupLabel_three_iff`, `TauCeti.exists_transitiveGroupLabel_four_iff`,
  `TauCeti.exists_transitiveGroupLabel_five_iff`: a subgroup carries a label exactly when it is
  transitive.
