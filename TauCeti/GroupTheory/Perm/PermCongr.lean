# Transporting permutation groups along an equivalence

An equivalence `e : α ≃ β` induces the group isomorphism `Equiv.permCongrHom e` from
`Equiv.Perm α` to `Equiv.Perm β`, and so carries a subgroup `G ≤ Equiv.Perm α` to the subgroup
`G.map e.permCongrHom.toMonoidHom ≤ Equiv.Perm β`. The two subgroups are the same permutation
group written in two numberings of the points. This file records that the invariants of a
permutation group which do not depend on the numbering are unchanged: containment in the
alternating group, transitivity, and primitivity. (The order is `Subgroup.card_map_of_injective`.)

The same invariants may also be read off the image of a permutation representation instead of
the acting group: an action of `G` on `α` and the action of the subgroup
`(MulAction.toPermHom G α).range` of `Equiv.Perm α` have the same orbits and the same blocks.

## Main results

* `Equiv.map_permCongrHom_le_alternatingGroup_iff`: transport preserves evenness.
* `Equiv.conj_eq_permCongrHom`: conjugation by a permutation is transport along that
  permutation.
* `Equiv.isPretransitive_map_permCongrHom_iff`: transport preserves transitivity.
* `Equiv.isPreprimitive_map_permCongrHom_iff`: transport preserves primitivity.
* `MulAction.isPretransitive_range_toPermHom_iff`, `MulAction.isPreprimitive_range_toPermHom_iff`:
  a group action and its image in the permutations are transitive, respectively primitive,
  together.
