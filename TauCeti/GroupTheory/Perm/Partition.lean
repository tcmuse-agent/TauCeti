# Cycle types that count fixed points

`Equiv.Perm.cycleType σ` lists the lengths of the cycles of `σ` that are at least two, so it
forgets the fixed points and is a partition of `σ.support.card` rather than of the ambient
cardinality. The factorization type of a polynomial modulo a prime is, by contrast, a partition
of the degree that keeps its parts equal to one. The corrected invariant

`σ.cycleType + Multiset.replicate (Fintype.card α - σ.support.card) 1`

is already in Mathlib: it is `(Equiv.Perm.partition σ).parts`, the multiset of parts of
`Equiv.Perm.partition`, and `Equiv.Perm.parts_partition` is its defining equation. This file adds
the API that a comparison with a multiset of factor degrees needs, on that multiset.

## Main results

* `fullCycleType` is the canonical name for the complete cycle-length multiset; its bridge to
  Mathlib's partition API and its sum, identity, conjugacy, and transport lemmas are included.
* `Equiv.Perm.count_one_parts_partition`, `Equiv.Perm.count_parts_partition_of_ne_one`: the parts
  equal to one are the fixed points of `σ`, and at every value other than one the multiset counts a
  part as often as `Equiv.Perm.cycleType` does. Together with Mathlib's
  `Equiv.Perm.filter_parts_partition_eq_cycleType` these say that no information is gained or
  lost.
* `Equiv.Perm.parts_partition_eq_cycleType_iff`: the correction is trivial exactly for a
  permutation with no fixed point.
* `Equiv.Perm.parts_partition_conj`: the multiset is constant on conjugacy classes.
* `Equiv.Perm.lcm_parts_partition`, `Equiv.Perm.sign_of_parts_partition`: the order and the sign
  of a permutation, read off the corrected multiset. These are the two invariants that a single
  exhibited factorization type contributes to the group that exhibits it.
* `Equiv.Perm.exists_orderOf_eq_iff`: the orders of the permutations of a finite type are exactly
  the least common multiples of the partitions of its cardinality.
* `Equiv.Perm.parts_partition_permCongr`: transport along an equivalence `α ≃ β` of the underlying
  types leaves it unchanged. Its ingredient `Equiv.Perm.cycleType_permCongr` is proved here too,
  since Mathlib records only `Equiv.Perm.sign_permCongr`. The form for `Equiv.permCongrHom`, the
  group isomorphism a relabelling induces, needs no separate lemma: Mathlib's `simp` lemma
  `Equiv.permCongrHom_coe` rewrites it to `Equiv.permCongr`.
* `Equiv.Perm.parts_partition_of_isCycle`, `Equiv.Perm.parts_partition_swap`: the values on a cycle
  and on a transposition, which are the two shapes the low-degree recognition theorems read.
* `Equiv.Perm.cycleType_eq_singleton_iff`: a single cycle length `n` characterizes a cycle moving
  `n` points; through `Equiv.Perm.filter_fullCycleType_eq_cycleType` this reads a cycle off a full
  cycle type.
* `Equiv.Perm.fullCycleType_eq_map_card_filter`: the full cycle type is the multiset of orbit
  sizes, read through any function whose fibres are the orbits.
* `Equiv.Perm.orbitQuotientEquivCycleFactorsSumFixedPoints`: the classes of `Equiv.Perm.SameCycle`
  are the nontrivial cycle factors together with the fixed points, via the point-level map
  `Equiv.Perm.cycleFactorOrFixedPoint`.
* `Equiv.Perm.fullCycleType_eq_map_card_orbit`: the full cycle type is the multiset of the sizes
  of the orbits of `⟨σ⟩` on the carrier, with `Equiv.Perm.sameCycle_iff_mem_orbit_zpowers`,
  `Equiv.Perm.coe_support_cycleOf_eq_orbit_zpowers` and `Equiv.Perm.orbit_zpowers_eq_singleton`
  identifying those orbits with the cycle supports and the fixed points.

## Implementation notes

The definition `fullCycleType σ` below uses the same `[Fintype α] [DecidableEq α]` arguments as
`Equiv.Perm.partition`, so the invariant is a wrapper around its defining expression. The
public `pos_of_mem_fullCycleType` lemma exposes the positivity of its parts
(`Nat.Partition.parts_pos`),
and `count_fullCycleType_of_ne_one` exposes the non-one count comparison. The filter lemma
(`Equiv.Perm.filter_parts_partition_eq_cycleType`) and the completeness of the conjugacy invariant
(`Equiv.Perm.partition_eq_of_isConj`) remain stated for `partition.parts` and are available through
the defining bridge. Downstream statements use `(Equiv.Perm.partition σ).parts`, which is a bare
`Multiset ℕ` and so can be compared with a multiset of factor degrees directly; it is the bundled
`σ.partition`, whose type `Nat.Partition n` is indexed by the ambient cardinality, that cannot.

Since `Equiv.Perm.partition` takes the `DecidableEq α` of its carrier as an instance argument and
is not `noncomputable`, the multiset below is written at the carrier's own instance rather than at
`Classical.propDecidable`, which is what the downstream comparison with a factorization type is
stated with. The invariant and its API are in the `Equiv.Perm` namespace, so permutation
expressions can use dot notation and the statements sit alongside the partition lemmas they
refine.
