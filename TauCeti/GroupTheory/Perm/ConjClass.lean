# The conjugacy classes of a cycle type in a group of permutations

An `S_n`-cycle type can meet several conjugacy classes of a subgroup `G ≤ S_n`, and can meet none,
so the elements of `G` of a prescribed full cycle type are counted by a sum over a finite index
set of `G`-classes rather than by a single class size. This file names that index set, for a
group of permutations of any finite carrier, and identifies the union of those classes with the
elements of that cycle type. A finite group has only finitely many conjugacy classes, so the
classes of a given cycle type form a `Finset`, and the count over them is a finite sum of class
sizes.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Subgroup.classesOfFullCycleType`: the conjugacy classes of `G` whose members have full
  cycle type `mu`.
* `TauCeti.Subgroup.iUnionClassesOfFullCycleType`: the set of the elements of `G` of full cycle
  type `mu`, the union of those classes.
* `TauCeti.Subgroup.mem_iUnionClassesOfFullCycleType`: an element of `G` is a member of one of the
  classes of type `mu` exactly when it has full cycle type `mu`.
* `TauCeti.Subgroup.mem_iUnion_classesOfFullCycleType`: that same characterization with the union
  of the classes written out.

/-- The conjugacy classes of the subgroup `G` whose members have full cycle type `mu`.

One `S_n`-cycle type can meet several `G`-classes, and can meet none, so the elements of `G` of a
prescribed cycle type are counted by a sum over this index set rather than by one class size. -/
