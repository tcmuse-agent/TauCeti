# Closure properties of finitely generated groups

Mathlib has a substantial theory of finitely generated commutative groups in
`Mathlib/GroupTheory/FiniteAbelian/Basic.lean` — the structure theorem, `finite_of_fg_isMulTorsion`,
and `Subgroup.finiteIndex_range_powMonoidHom_of_fg`, which is the finiteness of `G ⧸ Gⁿ`. Three
closure properties it does not carry are collected here.

## Main results

* `AddSubgroup.fg_of_addCommGroup` and `Subgroup.fg_of_commGroup`: a subgroup of a finitely
  generated commutative group is finitely generated. The argument is Noetherianity of `ℤ`, so the
  *additive* statement is the foundational one and the multiplicative statement is transported
  from it through `Additive`; `to_additive` cannot relate them — it would have to translate the
  `ℤ`-module argument itself — so the pair is written out by hand and registered with
  `to_additive existing`. Both are `instance`s, matching how Mathlib states its other `FG` closure
  properties (`Group.fg_range`, `QuotientGroup.fg`, `Subgroup.fg_of_index_ne_zero`).
* `Subgroup.fg_of_fg_map_of_fg_inf_ker`: a subgroup `K` whose image `K.map φ` and whose
  intersection `K ⊓ φ.ker` with the kernel are finitely generated is itself finitely generated.
  This is the `Subgroup` analogue of Mathlib's `Submodule.fg_of_fg_map_of_fg_inf_ker`, an absence
  Mathlib records explicitly — a comment in
  `Mathlib/NumberTheory/NumberField/Units/DirichletTheorem.lean` restructures a proof "due to no
  `Subgroup` version of `Submodule.fg_of_fg_map_of_fg_inf_ker` existing". It carries the generator
  argument, and needs no commutativity.
* `Group.fg_of_fg_ker_of_fg_range`: an extension of finitely generated groups is finitely
  generated — if the kernel and the range of `φ : G →* H` are finitely generated then so is `G`.
  It is the `K = ⊤` case of the previous result, and is derived from it. It is a plain theorem
  rather than an instance, because `φ` is an explicit argument that typeclass resolution cannot
  infer.

Both are `@[to_additive]`, and both are steps towards the `S`-unit group being finitely
generated, which `TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` §Layer 6 names as an input to the weak
Mordell–Weil theorem: the group of `S`-units sits in an extension whose kernel is the unit group
of the base and whose range is a subgroup of a free group of rank `|S|`, so establishing finite
generation needs exactly these two facts. The finiteness that the descent then applies to it is
Mathlib's
`Subgroup.finiteIndex_range_powMonoidHom_of_fg`, read through
`Subgroup.finiteIndex_iff_finite_quotient`; nothing here reproves it.

`AddSubgroup.fg_of_addCommGroup`, `Subgroup.fg_of_commGroup` and `Group.fg_of_fg_ker_of_fg_range`
are adapted from Michael Stoll's elliptic-curves formalisation
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, `EllipticCurves/Mathlib/SelmerGroup.lean` at the
roadmap's pin `66889eada51a`, Apache 2.0, by Michael Stoll). Following this repository's convention
for adapted material, the upstream authorship is credited here rather than in the copyright header.

**`Subgroup.fg_of_fg_map_of_fg_inf_ker` is new here**, with no counterpart in that source, which
has only the `K = ⊤` case; Mathlib records the general statement's absence in the comment at
`Mathlib/NumberTheory/NumberField/Units/DirichletTheorem.lean` quoted above. The generator
argument is Stoll's, restated for a subgroup.

That source file also carries `finite_modPow`, `finite_of_fg_of_pow_eq_one` and two `ℤ`-module
translation helpers. **None of them is ported: all four are now in Mathlib** — as
`Subgroup.finiteIndex_range_powMonoidHom_of_fg`, `CommGroup.finite_of_fg_isMulTorsion`, the
instance `AddMonoid.FG.to_moduleFinite_int`, and `Module.Finite.iff_addGroup_fg` composed with
`AddGroup.fg_iff_mul_fg`. The source predates those additions, some of which its own author
upstreamed, so check Mathlib again before porting anything further from it.

**Concurrent work upstream.** The open Mathlib pull request
[mathlib4#40791](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/40791) ("dirichlet's s-unit
theorem", by `vvvv-ops`, open since 2026-06-19) carries two of the results here as file-local
helpers of `Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/SUnit.lean`, under different names:
`Subgroup.fg_of_commGroup` as `Subgroup.fg_of_fg_commGroup`, and
`Group.fg_of_fg_ker_of_fg_range` as `CommGroup.fg_of_fg_ker_of_fg_range` — the latter
`CommGroup`-only, where the version here needs no commutativity. On a bump that lands #40791, drop
`Subgroup.fg_of_commGroup` in favour of upstream's; the extension lemma here is strictly more
general, and `Subgroup.fg_of_fg_map_of_fg_inf_ker` has no counterpart there at all.
