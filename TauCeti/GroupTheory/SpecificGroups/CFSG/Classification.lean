# The statement of the classification of finite simple groups

This file assembles the explicit cyclic, alternating, Lie-type, and sporadic carriers indexed by
`TauCeti.CFSGIndex`. It then records the classification as a named proposition. No finiteness or
simplicity property of a listed carrier is asserted here, and the classification proposition is
not proved. The Lie-type branches use explicit carriers; their identification with the pinned
simply connected group schemes remains separate. The sporadic branches use the recorded
finite presentations, without assuming any recognition theorem for the presented groups.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ValidLieTypeIndex.Group`: the concrete fixed-point, derived-subgroup, central-quotient
  carrier selected by a valid Lie-type index.
* `TauCeti.CFSGIndex.Group`: the concrete carrier selected by an index on the classification list.
* `TauCeti.ClassificationStatement`: every finite simple group is isomorphic to a listed carrier,
  with `TauCeti.classificationStatement_iff` stating the quantified proposition it names.
* `TauCeti.classificationStatement_of_zero`: the universe-zero statement implies the statement in
  every universe.
