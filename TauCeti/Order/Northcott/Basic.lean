# Finite real-cutoff carriers for Northcott functions

This file packages the finite carrier selected by a real cutoff for a natural-valued Northcott
function, together with generic summatory functions over that carrier. The carrier depends only
on the integer part of the cutoff, and for a nonnegative cutoff it agrees with the one selected by
its natural floor.
