# The sampling laws of a graphon form an exchangeable graph law

Sampling `l` independent points from a graphon and then tossing an independent coin for each
unordered pair produces a law on `SimpleGraph (Fin l)`. Those laws are consistent under
restriction of the label set — that is
`TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.sampleGraph_map_comap` — so the whole family is an exchangeable graph
law, which is what this file packages.

The upper mass of a pattern under a sampling law is its graphon homomorphism density: the sample
contains `F` exactly when every edge of `F` wins its coin toss, whose conditional probability at
fixed positions is the product of the edge factors of `F`. Hence sampling laws are dissociated:
the upper masses of a disjoint union of patterns multiply because homomorphism densities do.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.sampleExchangeableLaw` — the sampling laws of a graphon, packaged as
  an exchangeable graph law.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.upperMass_sampleExchangeableLaw` — the upper mass of a pattern under
  a sampling law is its homomorphism density;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.sampleGraph_Ici` — the same identity as a measure of an upper ray;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.sampleGraph_eq_of_forall_homDensity_eq` — graphons with the same
  homomorphism densities on `n` vertices have the same `n`-vertex sampling law;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.isDissociated_sampleExchangeableLaw` — sampling laws are dissociated.
