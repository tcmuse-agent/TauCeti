# Exchangeable graph laws

An exchangeable random graph on an unbounded label set is presented here by its finite marginals:
a probability law on `SimpleGraph (Fin k)` for every `k`, consistent under pulling a graph back
along every injection of labels `Fin k ↪ Fin l`. Consistency along *all* injections is a single
hypothesis doing two jobs: the permutations of `Fin k` give invariance under relabelling, and the
inclusions `Fin k ↪ Fin (k + 1)` give the projectivity that makes the family the
finite-dimensional distributions of one random graph.

The observable through which a graph parameter reads off such a law is the **upper mass** of a
finite pattern `F`: the probability `P(F ≤ ·)` that the level-`k` sample contains `F`. Upper
masses take values in `[0, 1]`, take the value `1` at the edgeless pattern, and are unchanged by
relabelling a pattern along an injection — the consistency hypothesis seen on upper events. They
are a complete observable: an upper mass is the total probability of the graphs above the pattern,
so downward induction along the finite lattice of graphs recovers the probability of an individual
graph, and hence the whole law, from the upper masses
(`MeasureTheory.Measure.ext_of_Ici_of_finite`).

The label set is always a finite `Fin k`, so its graphs form a finite measurable space and every
set of them is measurable; no measurability side conditions appear below.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.ExchangeableGraphLaw` — a consistent family of finite graph laws, with
  each marginal a probability measure by instance;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.ExchangeableGraphLaw.upperMass` — the probability that the sample
  contains a fixed finite pattern.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.ExchangeableGraphLaw.upperMass_map` — upper masses are unchanged by
  relabelling the pattern along an injection;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.ExchangeableGraphLaw.upperMass_antitone` — a stronger pattern has a
  smaller upper mass;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.ExchangeableGraphLaw.upperMass_bot`,
  `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.ExchangeableGraphLaw.upperMass_nonneg` and
  `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.ExchangeableGraphLaw.upperMass_le_one` — the range of an upper mass;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.ExchangeableGraphLaw.upperMass_eq_sum` — an upper mass is the total
  probability of the graphs containing the pattern;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.ExchangeableGraphLaw.ext_upperMass` — the upper masses determine the
  law.
