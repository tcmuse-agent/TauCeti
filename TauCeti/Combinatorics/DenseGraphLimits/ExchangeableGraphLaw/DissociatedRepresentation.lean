# Dissociated exchangeable graph laws are sampling laws

A dissociated exchangeable graph law is the sampling law of a single graphon on the unit interval
(`exists_graphon_of_isDissociated`). Together with `isDissociated_sampleExchangeableLaw` this
identifies the dissociated exchangeable graph laws with the sampling laws of graphons.

Under any mixing measure of a dissociated law (`exists_mixtureExchangeableLaw_eq`), every
homomorphism density is almost surely equal to the corresponding upper mass
(`ae_homDensityOnSpace_eq_upperMass_of_isDissociated`), so all homomorphism-density coordinates are
almost surely constant at once. This does not say that the mixing measure is a Dirac mass, and
neither the mixing measure nor the graphon is claimed to be unique.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.ae_homDensityOnSpace_eq_upperMass_of_isDissociated` — under a mixing
  measure of a dissociated law, `t(F, ·)` is almost surely the upper mass of `F`.
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.exists_graphon_of_isDissociated` — **every dissociated exchangeable
  graph law is the sampling law of a graphon on the unit interval.**
