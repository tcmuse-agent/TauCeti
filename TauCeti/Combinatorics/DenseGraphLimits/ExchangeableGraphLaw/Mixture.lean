# Graphon mixtures of exchangeable graph laws

A probability measure `P` on graphon space describes a two-stage random graph: first draw a graphon
class `⟦W⟧ ∼ P`, then sample `G(k, W)`. This file makes that construction precise and packages
its marginals as an exchangeable graph law, the *object direction* of the Diaconis–Janson
correspondence between exchangeable random graphs and mixtures of graphons.

The second stage must depend only on the graphon class, and it does: the law of `G(k, W)` is
determined by its upper masses, which are the homomorphism densities of `W`, and those are
unchanged at cut distance zero. So sampling descends to a map from graphon space to laws of
finite graphs. That map is measurable for the Borel σ-algebra of the cut metric, because on the
finite lattice of graphs a law is measurable in a parameter once its upper-ray masses are, and
those masses are the continuous descended homomorphism densities. The mixture law at level `k` is
the Giry-monad bind of `P` against this map. Its consistency under relabelling is inherited
fiberwise from the sampling laws, its upper mass of a pattern `F` is the `P`-average of `t(F, ·)`,
and the mixture of a Dirac mass at `⟦W⟧` is the sampling law of `W`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.sampleGraphOnSpace` — the law of the sampled graph, as a function of
  the graphon class;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.mixtureExchangeableLaw` — the exchangeable graph law of a mixing
  measure on graphon space.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.sampleGraph_eq_of_cutDist_eq_zero` — graphons at cut distance zero,
  on arbitrary carriers, have the same sampling laws;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.measurable_sampleGraphOnSpace` — the sampling law depends measurably
  on the graphon class;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.upperMass_mixtureExchangeableLaw` — the upper mass of a pattern under
  a mixture law is the average of its homomorphism density against the mixing measure;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.mixtureExchangeableLaw_diracProba` — the mixture of a Dirac mass at a
  graphon class is that graphon's sampling law;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.mixtureExchangeableLaw_eq_iff` — two mixing measures have the same
  mixture law exactly when they have the same homomorphism-density moments.
