# Exchangeable graph laws as jointly exchangeable array laws

An exchangeable law on infinite graphs is the law of a symmetric `Bool`-valued array with `false`
on the diagonal, jointly exchangeable under simultaneous relabelling of both axes. This file is the
law-level adapter between the two: the array law `arrayLaw μ` of a law on graphs, the graph law
`graphLawOfArray ρ` of a law on arrays, the bundled equivalence `graphLawArrayLawEquiv` between
exchangeable laws on infinite graphs and the jointly exchangeable probability laws carried by the
symmetric `false`-diagonal arrays, and the dissociation compatibility that lets the array theory
speak about graph laws.

* **Dissociation.** The finite law attached to `L` is dissociated exactly when its array law is
  jointly dissociated (`isDissociated_iff_jointlyDissociated`). The graph notion is independence
  of two consecutive label windows; the array notion is independence of the arrays read along
  disjoint index sets; for a jointly exchangeable law consecutive windows suffice
  (`indepFun_restrict_of_forall_Ico`), and each window of a graph is the block restriction of its
  array.
* **Convex mixtures.** The array law and the graph law are pushforwards, so they are linear in
  the measure (`arrayLaw_add`, `arrayLaw_smul`, `graphLawOfArray_add`, `graphLawOfArray_smul`),
  and the array laws of graph laws are
  exactly the jointly exchangeable probability laws carried by the symmetric `false`-diagonal
  arrays. Extremality among those laws is joint dissociation
  (`jointlyDissociated_iff_mem_extremePoints_on`), so dissociation of a graph law is extremality of
  its array law (`isDissociated_iff_arrayLaw_mem_extremePoints`).

The carrier-level bridge, the adjacency array of a graph and the graph of an array, is
`ExchangeableGraphLaw/AdjArray.lean`. The window of a graph on the labels `[k, k + n)` corresponds
to the block `[k, k + n)²` of its adjacency array.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.arrayLaw`, `graphLawOfArray`, `infiniteGraphLawOfArray` — the
  law-level adapter with its defining pushforwards (`arrayLaw_def`, `graphLawOfArray_def`,
  `infiniteGraphLawOfArray_law`) and the round trips (`graphLawOfArray_arrayLaw`,
  `arrayLaw_graphLawOfArray`, `arrayLaw_infiniteGraphLawOfArray`), and
  `graphLawArrayLawEquiv`, the bundled equivalence.
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.isDissociated_iff_forall_indepFun_restrict` — dissociation of the
  finite law is block independence of the array law at consecutive windows.
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.isDissociated_iff_jointlyDissociated` — dissociation compatibility.
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.isDissociated_iff_arrayLaw_mem_extremePoints`,
  `isDissociated_iff_graphLawArrayLawEquiv_mem_extremePoints`,
  `isDissociated_graphLawArrayLawEquiv_symm` — dissociation of a graph law is extremality of its
  array law, in either direction of the adapter.
