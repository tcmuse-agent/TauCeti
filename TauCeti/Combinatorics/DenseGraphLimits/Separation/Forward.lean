# Forward separation of graphons by homomorphism densities

The forward half of graphon separation is the qualitative consequence of the cut-distance form of
the counting lemma

`|t(F, U) - t(F, W)| ≤ e(F) * δ□(U, W)`

(`abs_homDensity_sub_le_cutDist`): graphons at cut distance zero have equal homomorphism densities
for every finite graph.  Here `U` and `W` may live on different probability spaces, and no
standard-Borel, atomlessness, or common-carrier assumption is needed.

This is the easy direction of the inverse-counting/separation theorem.  The converse — equality of
all homomorphism densities implies cut distance zero — is the inverse counting lemma
`TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.cutDist_eq_zero_of_forall_homDensity_eq` in
`TauCeti.Combinatorics.DenseGraphLimits.Separation.Inverse`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.forall_homDensity_eq_of_cutDist_eq_zero` — graphons at cut distance
  zero have the same homomorphism densities.

/-- **Forward separation, across arbitrary carriers.** If two graphons have cut distance zero,
then every finite graph has the same homomorphism density in them.

This is the counting direction of graphon separation.  It has no standard-Borel or atomlessness
hypothesis because both the coupling counting lemma and the coupling-primary cut distance are
defined on arbitrary probability carriers. -/
