# Beta-numbers of a Young diagram

Fix a Young diagram `μ` and a bound `r` on its number of rows. The `i`-th **beta-number**
`YoungDiagram.betaNumber μ r i = μ.rowLen i + (r - 1 - i)` is the length of row `i` plus the number
`r - 1 - i` of rows of the bounding `r`-row strip that lie below it. Adding that shift to the weakly
decreasing row lengths makes the beta-numbers strictly decrease across the indices `i < j < r`
inside the bound, so those `r` numbers are pairwise distinct; that is the whole point of the
construction.  This file also records that the natural-number product of their differences casts
to the corresponding integer product.

Beta-numbers are the bookkeeping device behind the Frobenius determinant formula and the
Frame-Robinson-Thrall route to the hook-length formula. Their relation to hook lengths --- for the
exact row count `r = μ.colLen 0` the beta-numbers of the nonempty rows `i < μ.colLen 0` are the
hook lengths of the first column, and in general they describe a row of hook lengths --- needs the
hook-length API and is developed in `TauCeti/Combinatorics/Young/HookLength/BetaNumbers.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `YoungDiagram.betaNumber`: the beta-numbers of `μ` relative to a bound `r` on its number of rows.

## Main results

* `YoungDiagram.betaNumber_lt_betaNumber`: the beta-numbers strictly decrease across the indices
  `i < j < r` inside the bound.
* `YoungDiagram.injOn_betaNumber`: the beta-numbers of the indices `i < r` are pairwise distinct.
* `YoungDiagram.eq_of_betaNumber_eq`: a Young diagram with at most `r` rows is determined by its
  beta-numbers of the indices `i < r`.
* `YoungDiagram.cast_prod_betaNumber_sub`: casts the product of beta-number differences from
  `ℕ` to `ℤ`.

  1, Example 1, for beta-numbers and the description of a row of hook lengths by them.

lie below it. For `r = μ.colLen 0` and a nonempty row `i < μ.colLen 0` this is the hook length of
the first cell of row `i`; see `YoungDiagram.betaNumber_eq_hookLength`. -/

lengths are recovered by subtracting the common shift `r - 1 - i`, and outside it both diagrams
have empty rows. -/
