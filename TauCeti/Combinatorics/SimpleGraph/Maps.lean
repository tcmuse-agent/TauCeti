# Pulling a simple graph back along an embedding

Pulling a simple graph back along an embedding `f : V ↪ W` forgets everything outside the window
`f '' V`, and pushing the result forward again recovers exactly what the window sees: the
intersection of the graph with the complete graph supported on that window. Since pushing forward
along an embedding is injective, prescribing a pullback is therefore the same as prescribing that
intersection — a condition on an induced subgraph turned into a condition on edges.

The window of a graph on `ℕ` spanned by the first `n` labels is the pullback along `Fin.val`; it
is how a graph on an infinite label set is read as a finite sample.

## Main definitions

* `SimpleGraph.restrictFin` — the initial `n`-label window of a graph on `ℕ`.

## Main results

* `SimpleGraph.map_comap_eq_inf_map_top` — pushing a pullback forward cuts the graph down to the
  window;
* `SimpleGraph.comap_eq_iff_inf_map_top` — prescribing a pullback is prescribing that
  intersection;
* `SimpleGraph.map_sup` — pushing forward along any map commutes with joins;
* `SimpleGraph.restrictFin_adj` — two labels are joined in a window exactly when they are joined
  in the graph.
