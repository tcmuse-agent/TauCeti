# The thrice-punctured sphere

The thrice-punctured sphere `ℙ¹(ℂ) ∖ {0, 1, ∞}` is the base of the three-point covers classified
by permutation triples and dessins d'enfants. This file fixes its affine model
`TauCeti.ThricePuncturedSphere := {z : ℂ // z ≠ 0 ∧ z ≠ 1}`, together with the point-set facts the
computation of its fundamental group and the classification of its finite covers run on.

* **The space.** It is an open subset of `ℂ`, hence Hausdorff, second countable, strongly locally
  contractible, locally path-connected and semilocally simply connected; it is path-connected
  because the complement of a countable set in `ℂ` is. The inclusion into the Riemann sphere
  `OnePoint ℂ` is an open embedding whose range is the complement of `{0, 1, ∞}`, which is what
  makes the name honest.
* **The basepoint and its symmetry.** The basepoint is `b = 1/2`, on the real segment between
  the punctures `0` and `1`; the involution `z ↦ 1 − z` fixes it.
* **The standard two-set cover** by `A = {z | re z < 1}` and `B = {z | 0 < re z}`. The set `A`
  is the convex half-plane `re z < 1` with the puncture `0` removed, `B` is the half-plane
  `0 < re z` with the puncture `1` removed, and `A ∩ B` is the open vertical strip
  `0 < re z < 1`, with no point removed because both punctures lie on its boundary lines. The
  strip is convex, so `A ∩ B` is path-connected and simply connected, and it contains `b`. These
  are the hypotheses on the intersection in the Seifert–van Kampen theorem for two open sets with
  simply connected intersection, through which `π₁` of the thrice-punctured sphere is computed to
  be free of rank two.
