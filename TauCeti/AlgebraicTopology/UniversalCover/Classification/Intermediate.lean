# The Galois correspondence is a correspondence of towers of covers

Pointed connected covers of `(X, x)` are classified by the subgroup of `π₁(X, x)` they recover,
and `IsCoveringMap.exists_continuousMap_comp_eq_iff_range_le` already says that a map of
pointed covers exists exactly when the recovered subgroups are nested. What that statement leaves
open is what kind of map it is. This file upgrades it: when the target cover is locally connected,
the map is itself a covering map, so a nesting of subgroups is realized by an intermediate
covering and not merely by a continuous comparison.

The upgrade is `IsCoveringMap.of_comp_eq`, which needs nothing about the subgroups: any
continuous map between two covering spaces of the same base is a covering map when its target is
locally connected.

Specializing to the covers built from subgroups turns the classification into an order statement.
For `H, K ≤ π₁(X, x₀)` the cover `UniversalCover x₀ / H` covers `UniversalCover x₀ / K`
compatibly with basepoints exactly when `H ≤ K`, because those covers recover `H` and `K`. The
universal cover itself sits above all nonempty covers after choosing points in a common fibre.
This is recorded separately because it needs no subgroup: the universal lifting property produces
the comparison map, and the upgrade above makes that map a covering map.

## Main declarations

* `IsCoveringMap.exists_isCoveringMap_comp_eq_iff_range_le`: **a pointed cover covers another,
  by a covering map over the base, exactly when the recovered subgroups are nested.**
* `TauCeti.UniversalCover.exists_isCoveringMap_comp_eq_proj`: **the universal cover covers a
  nonempty covering space of `X` after choosing points in a common fibre.**
* `TauCeti.UniversalCover.exists_isCoveringMap_subgroupQuotientProj_comp_eq_iff_le`: **the cover
  attached to `H` covers the cover attached to `K` exactly when `H ≤ K`.**

## References

This work consumes the based-path universal cover adapted from Kim Morrison's
[mathlib4#38292](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/38292), the lifting
criterion in Mathlib's `Topology/Homotopy/Lifting.lean` due to Junyan Xu, and the covers attached
to subgroups already built here. The mathematics is Hatcher, *Algebraic Topology*, Section 1.3.

/-- **A pointed cover covers another one, by a covering map over `X`, exactly when the subgroup it
recovers is contained in the subgroup the other recovers.**

This strengthens `IsCoveringMap.exists_continuousMap_comp_eq_iff_range_le`, which produces
only a continuous map: when the target is locally connected, a map of covers is automatically a
covering map, by `IsCoveringMap.of_comp_eq`. -/
