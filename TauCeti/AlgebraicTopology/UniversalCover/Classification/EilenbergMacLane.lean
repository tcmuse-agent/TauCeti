# Aspherical spaces through the universal cover and its subgroup quotients

Under the standing hypotheses of this development — `X` path-connected, locally
path-connected and semilocally simply connected — every homotopy group of `X` in a dimension
at least two is a homotopy group of the universal cover. Asphericity of `X` is therefore a
property of the universal cover alone: `X` is aspherical exactly when the higher homotopy
groups of `UniversalCover x₀` vanish. Since the universal cover is simply connected, that
condition says precisely that it is weakly contractible.

This turns the Galois correspondence of Stage 2 into a statement about Eilenberg--Mac Lane
spaces. Every subgroup `H ≤ π₁(X, x₀)` is realised by the connected cover
`UniversalCover x₀ / H`, whose fundamental group is `Hᵐᵒᵖ`, hence isomorphic to `H`; when `X` is a
`K(G, 1)` that cover is aspherical too, so it is a `K(H, 1)`. In particular every subgroup of
the fundamental group of a `K(G, 1)` is isomorphic to the fundamental group of a `K(H, 1)`
realised as a covering space of `X`.

The general covering-space input is
`IsCoveringMap.isAspherical_totalSpace`; the only work here is to supply the
universal cover and the covers attached to subgroups as instances of it, with their
distinguished basepoints.

This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/UniversalCovers/README.md`, Stage 4, item 13, "`K(G, 1)`
spaces", by tying that item to the Stage 2 classification: the covers produced by item 7 of
that stage are Eilenberg--Mac Lane spaces whenever the base is.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.UniversalCover.isAspherical_iff`: **a space is aspherical exactly when the higher
  homotopy groups of its universal cover vanish**.
* `TauCeti.UniversalCover.isEilenbergMacLaneSpaceOne`: the resulting `K(G, 1)` recognition
  principle.
* `TauCeti.UniversalCover.isAspherical_subgroupQuotient` and
  `TauCeti.UniversalCover.isEilenbergMacLaneSpaceOne_subgroupQuotient`: **the cover attached
  to `H ≤ π₁(X, x₀)` over a `K(G, 1)` is a `K(H, 1)`**.
