# Subgroups parametrise the pointed connected covers bijectively

Two halves of the correspondence between subgroups of `π₁(X, x₀)` and pointed connected covers
of `(X, x₀)` are already available. The comparison theorem
`IsCoveringMap.exists_homeomorph_comp_eq_iff_range_eq` says a pointed connected cover is
determined by the subgroup it recovers, and `TauCeti.UniversalCover.subgroupQuotientProj`
together with `TauCeti.UniversalCover.range_mapOfEq_subgroupQuotientProj` builds, for every
subgroup `H`, a pointed cover recovering `H`. What neither states is that *every* pointed
connected cover arises this way.

This file supplies that statement and reads the correspondence off it:

* a pointed connected cover of `(X, x₀)` is isomorphic over `X`, by a homeomorphism matching the
  chosen lift with the distinguished point, to `UniversalCover x₀ / H` for the subgroup `H` it
  recovers, and `H` is the *only* subgroup with that property;
* the covers attached to `H` and to `K` are isomorphic as pointed covers exactly when `H = K`,
  and as unpointed covers exactly when `H` and `K` are conjugate.

Together with the order statement
`TauCeti.UniversalCover.exists_isCoveringMap_subgroupQuotientProj_comp_eq_iff_le`, which says
the cover attached to `H` covers the cover attached to `K` precisely when `H ≤ K`, this is the
Galois correspondence between subgroups of `π₁(X, x₀)` and connected covers of `X`. The
regular-cover criterion is read off in the same way: the cover attached to `H` is regular
exactly when `H` is normal.

The standing hypotheses are those of the whole construction — `X` path-connected, locally
path-connected and semilocally simply connected — because the universal cover is what the
subgroup quotients are built from.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.UniversalCover.exists_homeomorph_subgroupQuotient_of_range_eq`: **a pointed connected
  cover is the quotient of the universal cover by the subgroup it recovers.**
* `TauCeti.UniversalCover.existsUnique_subgroup_homeomorph_subgroupQuotient`: **the recovering
  subgroup is the unique parameter that realises a given pointed connected cover**, so subgroups
  of `π₁(X, x₀)` parametrise pointed connected covers bijectively.
* `TauCeti.UniversalCover.exists_homeomorph_subgroupQuotient_comp_eq_iff_eq`: two subgroup
  quotients are isomorphic as *pointed* covers exactly when the subgroups are equal.
* `TauCeti.UniversalCover.exists_homeomorph_subgroupQuotient_comp_eq_iff_exists_eq_map_conj`: they
  are isomorphic as *unpointed* covers exactly when the subgroups are conjugate.
* `TauCeti.UniversalCover.isRegular_subgroupQuotientProj_iff_normal`: the cover attached to `H`
  is regular exactly when `H` is normal.

The mathematics is Hatcher, *Algebraic Topology*, Theorem 1.38 and the classification corollary
that follows it. The construction consumed here is the based-path universal cover adapted from
Kim Morrison's [mathlib4#38292](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/38292),
