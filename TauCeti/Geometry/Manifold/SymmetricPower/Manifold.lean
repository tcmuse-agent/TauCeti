# The symmetric power of a complex curve is a complex analytic manifold

Let `α` be a Hausdorff one-dimensional complex manifold, a Riemann surface in the case of interest.
Its `n`-th symmetric power `Sym α n` carries the elementary-symmetric charted structure
`TauCeti.symChartedSpace`, modelled on `Fin n → ℂ`. Its charts are the explicit charts
`TauCeti.symOpenPartialHomeomorph`, built from disjoint coordinate patches of `α` around the
distinct points of a tuple, and the transition between any two of them is analytic on its source
(`TauCeti.contDiffOn_symOpenPartialHomeomorph_trans`), because the changes of coordinate on `α`
are (`TauCeti.analyticAt_symm_trans`). Hence `Sym α n` is an analytic manifold: this
is the complex structure of `Sym^g(Σ)` in Ozsváth–Szabó, *Holomorphic disks and topological
invariants for closed three-manifolds*
([arXiv:math/0101206](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0101206)), §2.2, given there by the observation
that the elementary symmetric functions of local coordinates are holomorphic coordinates on the
symmetric power.

The statement is phrased with the explicit charted structure `TauCeti.symChartedSpace`, which is
deliberately not an instance; see its docstring.

## Main declarations

/-- **The symmetric power of a complex curve is a complex analytic manifold.** For a Hausdorff
one-dimensional complex manifold `α`, the elementary-symmetric charts of `Sym α n` have analytic
transition maps, so `TauCeti.symChartedSpace` makes `Sym α n` an analytic manifold modelled on
`Fin n → ℂ`. -/
