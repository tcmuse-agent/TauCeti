# Composing smooth embeddings with diffeomorphisms

Mathlib defines `Manifold.IsSmoothEmbedding` as an immersion that is also a topological embedding,
and lists `Diffeomorph.isSmoothEmbedding` as a `TODO` in
`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/SmoothEmbedding.lean`, because a general composite of immersions has to
combine two complements.

Composing with a **diffeomorphism** is elementary, and
`TauCeti/Geometry/Manifold/Immersion.lean` settles it at the level of immersions: a diffeomorphism
carries charts to charts, so both composites are immersions with the *same* complement. This file
adds the topological half — composing with a diffeomorphism on either side preserves being a
topological embedding — and packages the result as operations on the bundled type
`TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding`.

Since the composition is transparent, the bundled operations are just reindexing: a
`TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding` may be reparametrised by a diffeomorphism of its source
(`TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding.compDiffeomorph`) or transported by a diffeomorphism of its target
(`TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding.transDiffeomorph`). Reparametrisation leaves the image alone and
transport moves it by the ambient diffeomorphism, and the two assemble into an action of the
self-diffeomorphism group `TauCeti.Diff` of the target and a right action of that of the source;
the two actions commute, which is recorded as a `SMulCommClass` instance.

This is the transport layer that layer 4 of the geometric-topology roadmap
(`TauCetiRoadmap/GeometricTopology/README.md`) needs for its geometric presentations, where a knot
presentation is a smooth embedding of the circle into the ambient manifold `N`: reversing the
orientation of such a presentation and rotating its parametrisation are precisely precomposition
with a diffeomorphism of the circle, while the ambient `Diff(N)`-action is postcomposition.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isSmoothEmbedding_comp_diffeomorph` and
  `TauCeti.isSmoothEmbedding_diffeomorph_comp`, with their `_iff` companions: smooth embeddings are
  stable under composition with a diffeomorphism on either side.
* `TauCeti.isSmoothEmbedding_diffeomorph`: a diffeomorphism is a smooth embedding.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding.ofDiffeomorph`: a diffeomorphism as a bundled smooth embedding.
* `TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding.compDiffeomorph`: reparametrise a bundled smooth embedding by a
  diffeomorphism of its source.
* `TauCeti.SmoothEmbedding.transDiffeomorph`: transport a bundled smooth embedding by a
  diffeomorphism of its target.
* the `MulAction (Diff J N n) (SmoothEmbedding I J n M N)` given by transport, and the
  reparametrisation action of `(Diff I M n)ᵐᵒᵖ`.

  embeddings and their behaviour under composition.
