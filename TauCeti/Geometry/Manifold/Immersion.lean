# Composing immersions with diffeomorphisms, and immersions into finite dimensions

Mathlib defines `Manifold.IsImmersion` by a normal form in charts — `f` looks like `u ↦ (u, 0)`
for suitable charts of the source and the target — and lists `IsImmersion.comp` as a `TODO` in
`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/Immersion.lean`, because a general composite has to combine two
complements and needs the differential to split.

This file settles the special case that is elementary: composing with a **diffeomorphism** on
either side. Nothing has to be recombined, because a diffeomorphism carries charts to charts: if
`φ` is a chart of `M` in the maximal atlas and `e : M' ≃ₘ M` is a diffeomorphism, then `φ ∘ e` is
a chart of `M'` in the maximal atlas, and reading `f ∘ e` in it produces literally the same normal
form that `f` had in `φ`. The same argument on the other side pulls an ambient chart back along
`e⁻¹`. So both composites are immersions with the *same* complement.

Since a diffeomorphism is invertible, every composition rule here is in fact an equivalence, and
each is also stated in `_iff` form. The one-directional statements remain the primitive ones: they
need a manifold structure only on the manifold `e` introduces, whereas the `_iff` forms need one on
both sides, in order to apply the rule to `e.symm` as well.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.mem_maximalAtlas_diffeomorph_transOpenPartialHomeomorph`: a diffeomorphism pulls a chart
  of the maximal atlas back to a chart of the maximal atlas. This is the only geometric input.
* `TauCeti.isImmersion_comp_diffeomorph` and Mathlib’s `Manifold.IsImmersion.comp_diffeomorph`,
  together with
  their `Manifold.IsImmersionAt`, `Manifold.IsImmersionAtOfComplement` and
  `Manifold.IsImmersionOfComplement` counterparts and the `_iff` companions of all of them:
  immersions are stable under composition with a diffeomorphism on either side.
* `Diffeomorph.isImmersion`: a diffeomorphism is an immersion.
* `TauCeti.isImmersion_iff_forall_isImmersionAt`: for a finite-dimensional target model, a map is
  an immersion exactly when it is an immersion at every point.

`Manifold.IsImmersion` asks for one complement serving every point, so it is not obviously a
local property; Mathlib's docstring of `Manifold.IsImmersion.isImmersionAt` explains that the
converse of that lemma fails for infinite-dimensional targets. When the target model is
finite-dimensional, every complement of the source model has the same finite dimension, so any
two of them are isomorphic and pointwise immersions assemble to an immersion. This makes being
an immersion local, as needed to glue immersions defined on the pieces of an open cover.

/-- A diffeomorphism `e : M' ≃ₘ M` pulls a chart `φ` of the maximal atlas of `M` back to the chart
`φ ∘ e` of the maximal atlas of `M'`. This is the only geometric input to the composition results
below: it is what lets a normal form in charts be read on the other side of a diffeomorphism.

The name records the hypothesis: for a mere homeomorphism `e` the pullback is a chart of the
topological atlas, but not of the maximal `C^n` atlas. -/
