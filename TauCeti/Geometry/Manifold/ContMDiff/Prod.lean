# Smooth maps from products

Mathlib equips a product of model vector spaces both with the product of their self-models and
with the self-model of the product. This file provides the `C^n` bridge between those
definitionally distinct presentations.

These bridges are useful when transporting `C^n` and `C^n`-on-a-set statements between product
chart coordinates and the self-model of the product model space.

The file also records a tube lemma: a map from a product which is `C^n` at every point of a
compact slice `{x} × K` is `C^n` on a product of open neighbourhoods of `x` and of `K`.

## Main results

* `contMDiff_prod_modelWithCornersSelf_iff`: a map from a product of model vector spaces is `C^n`
  for the product of the self-models if and only if it is `C^n` for the self-model of the product.
* `contMDiffOn_prod_modelWithCornersSelf_iff`: the same bridge for `C^n` maps on a set.
* `TauCeti.exists_isOpen_prod_contMDiffOn`: the tube lemma for maps from a product which are
  `C^n` along a compact slice.
