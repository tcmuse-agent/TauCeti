# Locally flat embeddings

Topological manifolds admit embeddings that no smooth embedding can imitate: the Alexander horned
sphere is a topologically embedded `2`-sphere in `S³` bounding a non-simply-connected region, and a
wild arc in `ℝ³` is knotted although its domain is an interval. Theorems about topological
manifolds therefore quantify over *locally flat* embeddings, those that in suitable ambient charts
look like the standard coordinate slice.

This file introduces that notion and the structural API it is used through. The definition is built
in three layers.

* `TauCeti.IsSliceChart φ S A` says that a single chart `φ` of the ambient space flattens the set
  `A` onto the model slice `S`, in the sense that `φ '' (φ.source ∩ A) = φ.target ∩ S`.
* `TauCeti.IsSliceEmbedding S f` says that `f` is a topological embedding admitting a slice chart
  for `Set.range f` around every point of its image. Here `S` is an arbitrary subset of an
  arbitrary model space, so this is *not* local flatness; it is the transport layer on which the
  closure properties are proved, and it is stated relatively so that they can be.
* `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat F F' f` is local flatness proper: it is `IsSliceEmbedding` for the
  *standard coordinate slice* `F × {0}` of the model space `F × F'`, so ambient charts take values
  in `F × F'` and carry the image of `f` exactly onto the vanishing locus of the last `F'`
  coordinates. With `F = ℝⁿ` and `F' = ℝᵏ` this is the textbook `ℝⁿ × {0} ⊆ ℝⁿ⁺ᵏ`.

Codimension is not baked in: it is the choice of the complementary model `F'`, so codimension `0`
(`F'` a subsingleton, where local flatness is openness of the embedding), codimension `1` (where
collaring lives) and codimension `2` (where knotting lives) are all instances of the one predicate,
which is the point.

Local flatness is a local condition, so the load-bearing content is not the definition but its
closure properties: restriction to an open subset of the domain, locality, invariance under
homeomorphisms and open embeddings on either side, invariance under a change of model space, and
products. Those are proved here, together with two results that pin the notion down: in codimension
zero local flatness is exactly openness of the embedding, and a locally flat embedding has locally
closed image as soon as the origin of the complementary model is closed (on the relative layer, as
soon as the model slice is locally closed).

This is layer 2 of the geometric-topology roadmap, the substrate for topologically locally flat
discs (topological sliceness) and for stating the annulus conjecture.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsSliceChart`: an ambient chart flattening a set onto a model slice.
* `TauCeti.IsSliceChart.subtypeChart`: the chart on a flattened set induced by a zero-slice chart,
  with values in the tangential model.
* `TauCeti.IsSliceEmbedding`: an embedding flattened onto a given model slice by ambient charts.
* `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat`: a locally flat embedding, the case of the standard coordinate slice.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isSliceChart_iff`: a chart is a slice chart iff, on its source, membership in the set is
  read off as membership of the coordinates in the slice.
* `TauCeti.IsSliceChart.exists_target_eq`: a slice chart can be shrunk to have any prescribed open
  subset of its target as its target.
* `TauCeti.isLocallyFlat_iff_isSliceEmbedding`, `TauCeti.isLocallyFlat_iff` and
  `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.exists_isSliceChart`: the defining flattening charts, as the slice
  embedding for the standard slice, in pointwise form, and as an eliminator.
* `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.restrict` and `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.of_forall_exists_isOpen`: local
  flatness is a local property of the domain.
* `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.isOpenEmbedding_comp`, `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.of_isOpenEmbedding_comp`,
  `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.codRestrict`, `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.homeomorph_comp`,
  `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.comp_isOpenEmbedding`, `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.comp_homeomorph`: invariance
  under open embeddings and homeomorphisms of the ambient space and of the domain.
* `TauCeti.IsSliceEmbedding.transHomeomorph`: invariance under a homeomorphic change of model
  space.
* `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.comp`: a composite of locally flat embeddings is locally flat, under an
  explicit hypothesis that their flattening charts can be chosen compatibly, and
  `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.of_compatible_isSliceChart`, the form of it that assumes only the
  compatible pair of charts.
* `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.prodMap`: a product of locally flat embeddings is locally flat.
* `TauCeti.isLocallyFlat_iff_isOpenEmbedding`: in codimension zero, locally flat means open.
* `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.isLocallyClosed_range`: a locally flat image is locally closed, as soon as
  the origin of the complementary model is closed.
* `TauCeti.isLocallyFlat_prodMkLeft`: over a domain charted on `F`, the standard model
  `x ↦ (x, 0)` is locally flat.
* `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.exists_isOpenEmbedding_prod`: a locally flat embedding with seminormed
  complementary model has local product neighbourhoods.

## Implementation notes

The relative predicate `IsSliceEmbedding` is deliberately *not* the definition of local flatness,
and is not a substitute for it: its slice is an arbitrary subset of an arbitrary space, so taking
the model space to be `M` itself, the slice to be `Set.range f` and the chart to be
`OpenPartialHomeomorph.refl M` makes every embedding, wild ones included, a slice embedding. It is
the layer on which transport is proved, because the closure properties genuinely need a slice that
varies (a product of standard slices is a standard slice only after a permutation of coordinates,
which is where `IsSliceEmbedding.transHomeomorph` is used). Local flatness is
`IsLocallyFlat F F' f`, which fixes the slice to be the standard one, and that predicate does have
teeth: `TauCeti.isLocallyFlat_iff_isOpenEmbedding` shows that in codimension zero it is equivalent
to openness of the embedding, and `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.isLocallyClosed_range` rules out an image
that is not locally closed, which the horned sphere's complement-side wildness aside is already
enough to exclude embeddings no chart can flatten.

No membership in a prescribed atlas is required of the flattening chart: an
`OpenPartialHomeomorph M (F × F')` is automatically a chart of the maximal topological atlas of a
topological manifold `M` modelled on `F × F'`, so demanding atlas membership would be redundant
there and would needlessly restrict the definition on ambient spaces that are not manifolds. The
model-space data enters exactly as it does for `ChartedSpace`, through the codomain of the charts.

A slice chart is only asked to flatten the set *relative to its own target*, that is
`φ '' (φ.source ∩ A) = φ.target ∩ S` rather than `φ.target = F` together with
`φ '' (φ.source ∩ A) = S`. The relative form is the one that is genuinely local, hence the one
closed under restriction; the textbook form is not, since shrinking the source shrinks the target.
For the standard model, a chart in the relative sense can be shrunk to a ball around the point and
rescaled onto `(ℝᵐ, ℝⁿ)`, recovering the textbook form, but that comparison needs the linear
structure and is not formalised here.

Composing two locally flat embeddings `N ↪ M ↪ P` is not a formal consequence of the definition:
the chart of `M` flattening the inner embedding and the chart of `P` flattening the outer one are
chosen independently, and nothing makes them agree. `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.comp` therefore carries
that agreement as an explicit hypothesis on charts witnessing the local flatness of the two
factors — the outer chart reads the intermediate coordinates off the inner one along `g` — rather
than assuming the conclusion; the outer chart then flattens the composite, and the complementary
models multiply. Composition comes in two levels, because a witnessing chart can only be referred
to by exhibiting it, so the compatibility hypothesis necessarily re-exhibits the two charts and
thereby already carries the flattening content of the two factors. `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.comp` is
the statement in the shape it is used and read, with both factors locally flat;
`TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.of_compatible_isSliceChart` is what its proof actually consumes, a
compatible pair of charts around each point together with the embedding content of the conclusion
itself, and `comp` is a two-line consequence of it. There the compatibility hypothesis is kept down
to the part not already implied by the rest of it: the outer chart is only asked to detect
`range g` in one direction, the other direction and the fact that the inner chart is a chart around
`f x` both following from the agreement of the two charts together with injectivity of the outer
map. Both are stated only for the standard slice, since the compatibility condition refers to the
splitting `F × F'` of the intermediate model, which the relative layer does not have. The ambient
codimension-zero case needs no such hypothesis and is kept separate, as
`TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.isOpenEmbedding_comp` and its converse.

/-- The general form of `TauCeti.IsLocallyFlat.comp`: what makes a composite locally flat is a
compatible pair of charts around each point of the domain, and nothing else. It asks for a chart
`ψ` of `P` at `g (f x)` and a flattening chart `φ` of `M` for `f` such that `ψ` reads the
intermediate coordinates off `φ` along `g`, in the sense `ψ (g y) = (φ y, 0)` on the source of `φ`,
such that `ψ` sees no more of `range g` than `φ` charts, and such that on its source `ψ` detects
`range g` from the vanishing of the outer coordinate. That same `ψ` then flattens `g ∘ f`, whose
complementary model is the product of the two complementary models. Since `hcompat` already
supplies every flattening chart the conclusion needs, the only embedding content assumed is what
the conclusion itself carries, that `g ∘ f` is an embedding, together with injectivity of `g`. Only
the stated half of the flattening of `range g` by `ψ` is assumed, the other half being forced by
`hagree` and `hsub`; likewise `f x ∈ φ.source` is not assumed, since `hsub` and injectivity of `g`
already give it. -/

the outer chart reads the intermediate coordinates off the inner one along `g`, in the sense
