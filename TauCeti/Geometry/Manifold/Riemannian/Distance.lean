# Finiteness of the Riemannian distance, and the induced metric space

`Manifold.riemannianEDist I x y` is the infimum of the lengths of `C¹` paths from `x` to `y`, an
*extended* distance: it is `∞` as soon as no such path exists. This file identifies exactly when it
is finite, and uses that to promote the extended metric space structure
`EMetricSpace.ofRiemannianMetric` of a preconnected Riemannian manifold to an ordinary metric space
structure, which is what statements about `dist`, `ProperSpace` and `CompleteSpace` need.

The key point is that `{y | riemannianEDist I x y < ∞}` is clopen: it is open because nearby points
are at small Riemannian distance (`eventually_riemannianEDist_lt`), and its complement is open for
the same reason. Hence it contains the connected component of `x`. Conversely a `C¹` path is in
particular continuous, so a point at finite Riemannian distance from `x` lies in the connected
component of `x`. Together these give
`riemannianEDist_lt_top_iff_mem_connectedComponent`, of which finiteness on a preconnected manifold
is the special case that matters downstream.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Manifold.riemannianEDist_lt_top_iff_mem_connectedComponent`: the Riemannian distance from
  `x` to `y` is finite if and only if `y` lies in the connected component of `x`.
* `TauCeti.Manifold.riemannianEDist_ne_top`: on a preconnected manifold the Riemannian distance is
  never `∞`.
* `TauCeti.PseudoMetricSpace.ofRiemannianMetric` and `TauCeti.MetricSpace.ofRiemannianMetric`: the
  (pseudo)metric space structures of a preconnected Riemannian manifold, refining
  `PseudoEMetricSpace.ofRiemannianMetric` and `EMetricSpace.ofRiemannianMetric`; both satisfy
  `IsRiemannianManifold I M`.
* `TauCeti.IsRiemannianManifold.edist_le_pathELength` and
  `TauCeti.IsRiemannianManifold.dist_le_toReal_pathELength`: the ambient (extended) distance of a
  Riemannian manifold, read through `IsRiemannianManifold.out`, is bounded by the length of any
  `C¹` path.
* `TauCeti.IsRiemannianManifold.edist_le_of_norm_mfderiv_le`: the mean-value inequality for a
  `C¹` map from a normed space into a Riemannian manifold along a segment.
* `TauCeti.Manifold.le_riemannianEDist_of_forall_le_pathELength`: the extended distance is bounded
  below by any bound valid for the lengths of *all* `C¹` curves joining two points, since it is the
  infimum of those lengths.
