# A Riemannian manifold is a length space

The Riemannian distance between two points is the infimum of the *Riemannian* lengths of the `C¹`
paths joining them. Being a length space asks for the same infimum taken over the *metric* lengths
— total variations — of all *continuous* paths joining them. The two agree: a continuous path is
never shorter than the distance between its endpoints, and the metric length of a `C¹` path is at
most its Riemannian length, by `TauCeti.Manifold.eVariationOn_le_pathELength`, so the `C¹` paths
already realise the infimum.

This is what makes the purely metric notions of `TauCeti/Topology/MetricSpace/Length.lean`
available on a Riemannian manifold. No completeness is needed here; it is the refinement in which
the infimum is attained, `TauCeti.Manifold.isGeodesicSpace_of_completeSpace`, that needs it.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Manifold.isLengthSpace`: a manifold whose extended distance is the Riemannian distance
  is a length space.
