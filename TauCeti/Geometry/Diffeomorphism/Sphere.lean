# The orthogonal group acts on the sphere by diffeomorphisms

A linear isometry equivalence of a real inner product space `E` preserves norms, so it restricts
to a self-map of the unit sphere; this file shows that restriction is a diffeomorphism of the
sphere as an analytic manifold, and assembles the restrictions into a group homomorphism
`(E ≃ₗᵢ[ℝ] E) →* Diff (𝓡 n) (sphere (0 : E) 1) m` into the self-diffeomorphism group of
`TauCeti.Geometry.Diffeomorphism.Group`. Taking `E = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n + 1))`, whose
linear isometry group is the orthogonal group `O(n + 1)`, this is the reference inclusion
`O(n + 1) → Diff(Sⁿ)`.

The inclusion is continuous for the subspace topology on `O(n + 1)` and the weak Whitney `C^m`
topology on the diffeomorphism group, from `TauCeti.Geometry.Diffeomorphism.Topology`. More
generally, restricting a continuous family of linear isometry equivalences to the unit sphere
gives a continuous family of `C^m` maps. This is the map whose source and target the Smale
conjecture `Diff(S³) ≃ O(4)` (`[Kir97, Problem 4.34]`, Hatcher) compares: the conjecture asserts
that `TauCeti.orthogonalToDiffSphere 3 ω` is a homotopy equivalence, a statement that needs the
continuity proved here.

## Main definitions

* `LinearIsometryEquiv.unitSphereEquiv`: the self-equivalence of the unit sphere
  obtained by restricting a linear isometry equivalence.
* `LinearIsometryEquiv.unitSphereDiffeomorph`: that restriction as a `C^m`
  diffeomorphism of the unit sphere, viewed as a manifold modelled on `𝓡 n`.
* `LinearIsometryEquiv.unitSphereDiffHom`: the group homomorphism
  `(E ≃ₗᵢ[ℝ] E) →* Diff (𝓡 n) (sphere (0 : E) 1) m`.
* `TauCeti.orthogonalToDiffSphere`: the reference inclusion `O(n + 1) → Diff(Sⁿ)`, the case
  `E = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n + 1))` of `unitSphereDiffHom`.

## Main results

* `LinearIsometryEquiv.contMDiff_unitSphereEquiv`: the restriction to the unit sphere is
  `C^m` for every smoothness exponent.
* `LinearIsometryEquiv.isometry_unitSphereEquiv`: it is an isometry for the distance the
  sphere inherits from `E`, so the action is by isometries of the round sphere.
* `LinearIsometryEquiv.unitSphereDiffeomorph_neg_apply`: the diffeomorphism induced by
  `-1 ∈ O(n + 1)` is the antipodal map.
* `TauCeti.LinearMap.eq_of_eqOn_unitSphere`: a linear map is
  determined by its values on the unit sphere, whence
  `LinearIsometryEquiv.unitSphereDiffHom_injective` and
  `TauCeti.orthogonalToDiffSphere_injective`: the inclusion is injective, so `O(n + 1)` is
  realised as a subgroup of `Diff(Sⁿ)`.
* `Continuous.toContMDiffMap_unitSphereDiffeomorph`: the restriction to the unit sphere of a
  continuous family of linear isometry equivalences is continuous in the weak Whitney topology.
* `TauCeti.continuous_orthogonalToDiffSphere`: the reference inclusion `O(n + 1) → Diff(Sⁿ)` is
  continuous.

## Implementation notes

The declarations extending `LinearIsometryEquiv` here and in
`TauCeti.Geometry.Sphere.LinearIsometry` live in the root-level `LinearIsometryEquiv` namespace,
allowing receiver notation. The reference inclusion remains project-owned top-level API in
`TauCeti`; the auxiliary linear-map lemma remains in `TauCeti.LinearMap` as explained in the
generic file.
