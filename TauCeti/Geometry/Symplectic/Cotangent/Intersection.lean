# Intersections of the zero section with differential graphs

In a linear cotangent space, the zero section meets the graph of `df` precisely over the zeros of
`fderiv ℝ f`; for differentiable `f` these are the critical points of `f`. For finite-dimensional
`V`, at a point where `df` is differentiable, the two tangent spaces are complementary exactly
when the Hessian is invertible. These identifications are used when comparing Morse theory with
the exact Floer theory of a zero section and differential graph.

The statements use the continuous dual, as does the Liouville form on the normed cotangent model.
Transversality is the complementarity of the tangent subspaces in the product vector space. In
finite dimensions, injectivity of the Hessian suffices for this complementarity.

This is the linear cotangent-space model of the Morse--Floer comparison. See M. Audin and
M. Damian, *Morse Theory and Floer Homology*, Chapter 1, Exercise 2.

/-- Intersection points of the zero section and differential graph, expressed as a set of pairs,
lie precisely over the zeros of `fderiv ℝ f`, with zero cotangent covectors. Since `fderiv` is
zero where `f` is not differentiable, these zeros are the critical points of `f` only when `f` is
differentiable. -/
