# Mixed coordinates on the complex points of a split affine semigroup

An affine semigroup that splits as a product `(ι →₀ ℕ) × (κ →₀ ℤ)` of a free commutative monoid
and a free abelian group has a completely explicit space of complex points: a `ℂ`-algebra
homomorphism out of its monoid algebra is the same data as a family of complex numbers indexed by
`ι` together with a family of units of `ℂ` indexed by `κ`. The exponents of the free monoid factor
are nonnegative, so the corresponding coordinates are unconstrained, while the free abelian factor
contains the inverse of each of its generators and therefore forces the remaining coordinates to
be invertible.

This is the mixed chart `ℂ ^ k × (ℂ ^ *) ^ l` of toric geometry. The dual semigroup of a smooth
`k`-dimensional cone in a lattice of rank `k + l` splits in exactly this way, with `ι` indexing
the rays of the cone and `κ` the remaining vectors of an integral basis extending their primitive
generators. The coordinates indexed by `ι` may vanish: the boundary is the union of their
coordinate hyperplanes, while the coordinates indexed by `κ` remain units.

The identification is assembled from the universal properties of the two free factors, so it is a
bijection of the functor-of-points carrier and mentions no generating family. The main result is
that it is a homeomorphism for the monomial-embedding topology attached to an arbitrary finite
generating family of the semigroup: the topology of the complex points, defined with no reference
to a splitting, is the product topology of the mixed coordinates. Both directions are computed by
named lemmas, so no consumer has to unfold the equivalence: a coordinate of a point is its value
on the monomial of the corresponding standard generator, and conversely the value of a point on an
arbitrary monomial is the expected mixed monomial in the coordinates.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Toric.regularAffinePointEquiv`: the mixed coordinates of the complex points of a split
  affine semigroup, with `TauCeti.Toric.regularAffinePointEquiv_fst_apply`,
  `TauCeti.Toric.val_regularAffinePointEquiv_snd_apply` and
  `TauCeti.Toric.regularAffinePointEquiv_symm_apply_single` computing the two directions, and
  `TauCeti.Toric.apply_single_ne_zero_iff_regularAffinePointEquiv_fst_ne_zero` characterizing
  monomial nonvanishing.
* `TauCeti.Toric.continuous_regularAffinePointEquiv` and
  `TauCeti.Toric.continuous_regularAffinePointEquiv_symm`: both directions are continuous for the
  monomial-embedding topology of any finite generating family.
* `TauCeti.Toric.regularAffinePointHomeomorph`: the resulting homeomorphism.
