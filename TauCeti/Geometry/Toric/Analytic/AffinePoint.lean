# Complex points of an affine semigroup and their monomial-embedding topology

The complex points of the affine scheme of a commutative additive monoid `S` are the
`ℂ`-algebra homomorphisms `ℂ[S] →ₐ[ℂ] ℂ` out of the monoid algebra, equivalently the
multiplicative characters `Multiplicative S →* ℂ`. Evaluating such a point on a finite family
`g : Fin r → S` that generates `S` as an additive monoid gives a map into `ℂ^r`, and the
topology of the complex points is the one induced by that map.

This file constructs that topology and proves the facts a chart needs before any coordinates
are chosen: the evaluation map is injective, its range is the closed subset of `ℂ^r` cut out
by the binomial relations of the generating family, and the induced topology does not depend
on which finite generating family is used. Consequently the complex points form a Hausdorff,
second countable, locally compact space, and evaluation at every monomial is continuous.

Independence of the generating family is what makes the space, rather than one presentation of
it, the object of study: a semigroup that arises as the dual of a cone has no preferred finite
generating family, and later coordinate descriptions must be compared with a topology that was
not defined using them.

The construction is contravariantly functorial in the semigroup: a homomorphism `S →+ T` pulls
the complex points of `T` back to those of `S` through the induced map of monoid algebras, and
the pulled-back map is continuous whichever generating families topologize the two sides. These
are the maps by which face localizations and morphisms of fans act on affine charts, and an
isomorphism of semigroups, such as a choice of coordinates on the dual semigroup of a regular
cone, induces a homeomorphism.
