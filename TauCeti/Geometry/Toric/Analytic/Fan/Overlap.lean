# Pairwise overlaps of analytic affine toric charts

For two cones of a regular fan, the affine chart of their intersection embeds openly in
each cone chart. Its image is the overlap locus. Interchanging the cones gives a canonical
homeomorphism between the two overlap loci, obtained by passing through the intersection
chart. These are the open sets and transitions used in the gluing of the analytic fan.

The construction uses the diagram of affine complex points. In particular, the transition
is induced by restriction of characters and does not depend on generators chosen to present
the affine-point topologies.
