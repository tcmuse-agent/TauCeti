# Semiperfect rings

A ring is **semiperfect** when its radical quotient `R ⧸ Ring.jacobson R` is a semisimple ring and
idempotents lift modulo the radical. This is the hypothesis under which projective covers of
finitely generated modules exist, and it is the property of a finite-dimensional algebra that
`TauCeti/Algebra/Module/ProjectiveCover/Existence.lean` uses in its sharper, nilpotent form.

Mathlib packages the neighbouring notion, `IsSemiprimaryRing`: the radical is *nilpotent* and the
radical quotient is semisimple. Nilpotence of the radical makes its elements nil, so idempotents
lift along `R ↠ R ⧸ Ring.jacobson R` by Mathlib's
`exists_isIdempotentElem_eq_of_ker_isNilpotent`; a semiprimary ring is therefore semiperfect
(`TauCeti.IsSemiperfectRing.of_isSemiprimaryRing`), and a ring that is finite-dimensional over a
division ring acting compatibly with its multiplication — such as a finite-dimensional algebra over
a field — being an Artinian ring, is semiprimary and hence semiperfect
(`TauCeti.isSemiperfectRing_of_finiteDimensional`).

Bass' characterization — `R` is semiperfect exactly when every finitely generated `R`-module has a
projective cover — is not proved here. The existence half of it over a semiprimary ring, in the
stronger form that covers *every* module, is
`TauCeti.exists_isProjectiveCover`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsSemiperfectRing`: the radical quotient is semisimple and idempotents lift modulo the
  radical.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsSemiperfectRing.of_isSemiprimaryRing`: a semiprimary ring is semiperfect.
* `TauCeti.isSemiperfectRing_of_finiteDimensional`: a ring finite-dimensional over a division ring,
  such as a finite-dimensional algebra over a field, is semiperfect.
