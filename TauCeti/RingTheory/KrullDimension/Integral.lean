# Krull dimension along integral extensions

For an integral extension `R → S` the Krull dimensions of `R` and `S` are compared by the two
Cohen–Seidenberg theorems.

* *Incomparability*: a strict inclusion of primes of `S` contracts to a strict inclusion of primes
  of `R`, so contraction is strictly monotone on prime spectra and `dim S ≤ dim R`.
* *Lying over and going up*: when every prime of `R` is a contraction and chains of primes of `R`
  lift along `R → S`, every chain of primes of `R` is the contraction of a chain in `S` of the same
  length, so `dim R ≤ dim S`.

For an injective integral extension both hold, and the two dimensions agree. This is the step
that reduces the dimension of a finitely generated algebra over a field to that of a polynomial
ring through Noether normalization.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ringKrullDim_le_of_isIntegral`: `dim S ≤ dim R` for an integral `R`-algebra `S`.
* `TauCeti.ringKrullDim_le_of_hasGoingUp_of_surjective`: `dim R ≤ dim S` when `R → S` has going
  up and `Spec S → Spec R` is surjective.
* `TauCeti.ringKrullDim_eq_of_isIntegral_of_faithfulSMul`: `dim S = dim R` for an injective
  integral extension.
