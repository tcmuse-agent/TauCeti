# The truncated polynomial algebra `R[X]/(Xⁿ⁺¹)`

Mathlib builds `AdjoinRoot f` for any polynomial and, for a monic `f`, its power basis
`AdjoinRoot.powerBasis'`. It does not record what the quotient by a power of `X` looks like. This
file does: the class of `X` is nilpotent, and over a local ring `R` the algebra `R[X]/(Xⁿ⁺¹)` is
again **local**.

Locality is the useful form of the statement, because it is what pins the idempotents: through
`TauCeti.IsLocalRing.eq_zero_or_eq_one_of_isIdempotentElem` a truncated polynomial algebra has no
idempotent besides `0` and `1`. That is exactly the input to the indecomposability of a nilpotent
Jordan block, whose endomorphism algebra is `k[X]/(Xⁿ⁺¹)`.

The other half of that indecomposability argument -- that an endomorphism of the Jordan block *is*
multiplication by an element of `k[X]/(Xⁿ⁺¹)` -- needs nothing about `Xⁿ⁺¹` beyond monicity, so it
is stated for an arbitrary monic relator and lives with the rest of the general `AdjoinRoot`
material, as `AdjoinRoot.eq_mulRight_of_root_mul` in `TauCeti.RingTheory.AdjoinRoot.Basic`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isNilpotent_root_X_pow`: the class of `X` is nilpotent in `R[X]/(Xⁿ)`.
* `TauCeti.isLocalRing_adjoinRoot_X_pow`: over a local ring `R`, so is `R[X]/(Xⁿ⁺¹)`.

The dimension of `R[X]/(Xⁿ)` over `R` is not recorded here: `AdjoinRoot f` is by definition
`R[X] ⧸ (f)`, so Mathlib's `finrank_quotient_span_eq_natDegree` over a field, and
`finrank_quotient_span_eq_natDegree'` for a monic relator over a ring, already give it.

## Implementation notes

The evaluation `R[X]/(Xⁿ⁺¹) → R` reading off the constant term is `AdjoinRoot.lift` of the identity
of `R` at the root `0`, and `AdjoinRoot.lift_mk` computes it on a class. It is a step in the proof
of locality rather than API, so the three lemmas phrased against that unnamed map -- that it is well
defined, that its kernel consists of nilpotents, and that an element it sends to a unit is a unit --
are `private`.

Locality is proved from `IsLocalRing.of_isUnit_or_isUnit_one_sub_self`, splitting an element as its
constant term plus an element of the kernel: the constant term is a unit or its complement is
(`IsLocalRing.isUnit_or_isUnit_one_sub_self` in `R`), and adding a nilpotent to a unit leaves a unit
(`IsNilpotent.isUnit_add_left_of_commute`). Nontriviality, which that criterion needs, is
`RingHom.domain_nontrivial` applied to the constant-term map, `R` itself being nontrivial.

Everything is stated over a commutative ring; locality of course asks in addition that `R` be
local, which for the base field of the intended application is automatic.

Locality genuinely needs the exponent `n + 1`: `R[X]/(X⁰)` is the zero ring, which is not local.
