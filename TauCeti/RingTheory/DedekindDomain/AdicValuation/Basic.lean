# Normalized valuations of the fraction field of a Dedekind domain are adic

Mathlib attaches to every height one prime `𝔭` of a Dedekind domain `R` a normalized
`ℤᵐ⁰`-valued valuation `𝔭.valuation K` of the fraction field `K`, and shows that distinct primes
give inequivalent valuations. This file proves the converse: a normalized valuation of `K` whose
valuation ring contains `R` *is* `𝔭.valuation K` for a unique height one prime `𝔭` of `R`, namely
the centre of the valuation on `R`.

The general centre construction and its membership lemmas are in
`TauCeti.RingTheory.Valuation.Center`. There, `Valuation.heightOneSpectrum` bundles a nonzero
prime ideal as `HeightOneSpectrum R`; the Dedekind assumption here makes it a height one prime.

The value group of the adic valuation itself is read off from Mathlib's definition, and this file
records the one conversion the rest of the library needs: an element has order of vanishing `1`
at `v` exactly when its adic value is `WithZero.exp (-1)`, so the additive order of vanishing used
by the class-group interface and the multiplicative value can be read off from one another.

## Main results

* `Valuation.eq_valuation_of_forall_mem_asIdeal_iff`: a normalized valuation bounded by `1` on `R`
  and of positive value exactly on a height one prime `𝔭` is the adic valuation of `𝔭`.
* `Valuation.valuation_heightOneSpectrum`: the adic valuation of the centre of `w` on `R` is `w`.
* `Valuation.existsUnique_heightOneSpectrum_valuation_eq`: the centre is the only height one prime
  whose adic valuation is `w`.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.neg_log_valuation_eq_one_iff`: order of vanishing `1` at `v`
  is the value `WithZero.exp (-1)`, which relates the multiplicative value group of the adic
  valuation to the additive order of vanishing used by the class-group interface.

## Implementation notes

The comparison goes through `Valuation.isEquiv_iff_val_le_one` and the normalization lemma
`Valuation.eq_of_isEquiv_of_surjective`: both valuations are surjective onto `ℤᵐ⁰`, so it is
enough to see that they have the same valuation ring. That in turn uses only that the two
valuations are bounded by `1` on `R` and are `< 1` on the same elements of `R`, together with
Mathlib's `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.exists_primeCompl_mul_eq_or_mul_eq`, which writes an
arbitrary element of `K` as a fraction with denominator outside `𝔭`, in one of the two possible
directions.

The comparison theorems assume `R` is Dedekind and `w` is surjective. Surjectivity supplies
nontriviality through `Valuation.isNontrivial_of_surjective`, allowing the nonzero prime centre
to be bundled using the general construction.

/-- **An element has order of vanishing exactly `1` at `v` exactly when its adic value is
`WithZero.exp (-1)`.**

The value group of `HeightOneSpectrum.valuation` is `WithZero (Multiplicative ℤ)`, whose
multiplicative identity `1` is the value zero, that is, order of vanishing zero; an element of
order of vanishing `1` is instead written `WithZero.exp (-1)`, the value of a generator of
`v.asIdeal`.  So `v.valuation K x = 1` says that `x` is a local unit at `v`, which an element of
nonzero order of vanishing is not.  This is the equivalence that relates the multiplicative value
of an element to the additive order of vanishing used by the class-group interface, whose
`adicOrd` is `-WithZero.log` of this valuation. -/
