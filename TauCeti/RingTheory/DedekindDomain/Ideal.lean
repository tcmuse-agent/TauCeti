# Complements on ideals of a Dedekind domain

This file collects general facts about ideals and height-one primes of a Dedekind domain,
complementing `Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/Ideal/Lemmas.lean`. In particular, it develops
the predicate `Ideal.IsPrimeTo I S`, saying that `I` is nonzero and divisible by no prime in `S`,
together with its induction principle `Ideal.IsPrimeTo.induction_on` and its transport
`Ideal.isPrimeTo_comap_iff` along a ring isomorphism.

The predicate is closed under products (`Ideal.isPrimeTo_mul_iff`, its finite form
`Ideal.isPrimeTo_prod_iff`) and powers (`Ideal.isPrimeTo_pow_iff`), and forbidding one more
prime is `Ideal.isPrimeTo_insert_iff`. Complementing a set of primes
turns it into a *support* condition: `IsPrimeTo I Sᶜ` says that every prime factor of `I` lies in
`S`. The two extreme cases are `Ideal.isPrimeTo_univ_iff` (no prime factor at all, so `I = ⊤`) and
`Ideal.isPrimeTo_compl_singleton_iff` (a single allowed prime, so `I` is a prime power), and
`Ideal.IsPrimeTo.exists_eq_pow_mul` splits off one allowed prime at a time. The file also records
the prime-power factorization `Ideal.exists_eq_prod_pow` of an arbitrary nonzero ideal. Together
with the uniqueness statement `Ideal.eq_and_eq_of_pow_mul_eq_pow_mul` and the relative primality
`Ideal.IsPrimeTo.isRelPrime` of ideals supported on complementary sets, these are what turn a
finite set of primes into a finite Euler product in
`TauCeti/NumberTheory/ArithmeticDirichletSeries/EulerProduct/Basic.lean`.

It also collects how an isomorphism `e : R ≃+* R'` moves ideals: `Ideal.map e` preserves
divisibility (`Ideal.map_dvd_map_iff_of_ringEquiv`, `Ideal.map_pow_dvd_map_iff_of_ringEquiv`,
stated over commutative *semirings*, since the proofs use only that `Ideal.map e` and
`Ideal.map e.symm` are mutually inverse) and factorisation multiplicities
(`Ideal.count_factors_map_of_ringEquiv`), and Mathlib's transport `equivOfRingEquiv e` of height
one primes is `Ideal.map e` on underlying ideals
(`IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.asIdeal_equivOfRingEquiv`). Those four are the ideal-level
input to the adic-valuation transport in
`TauCeti/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/AdicValuation/Transport.lean`; they are adapted from
[AINTLIB](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB) (Apache-2.0), commit `513e83879e2f`,
`projects/HasseWeil/HasseWeil/WeilPairing/DivisorGalois.lean`.

`Ideal.IsPrimeTo` generalizes the `IsGood` predicate of
`TauCetiRoadmap/ArithmeticDirichletSeries/Suggested.lean`, where it is stated for the bad primes
of an ideal weight on a number field; the design of the predicate — nonzeroness included, so that
`⊥` is prime to no set at all — is taken from there, while nothing in it is specific to a number
field.

The file also identifies any height-one prime of a discrete valuation ring with its maximal ideal
(`IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.eq_maximalIdeal`), which is what lets a condition stated at
the height-one primes of such a ring be read as a condition on its valuation. It was split out of
material adapted from Michael Stoll's elliptic-curves formalisation
(`EllipticCurves/Mathlib/AdicCompletionExtension.lean` at the roadmap's pin `66889eada51a`,
Apache 2.0, by Michael Stoll), where it is the step behind `valuation_adicCompletion_algebraMap`.

The theorem `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.exists_mem_notMem` was split out of material
adapted from Michael Stoll's elliptic-curves formalisation
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, `EllipticCurves/Mathlib/SIntegers.lean` at the
roadmap's pin `66889eada51a`, Apache 2.0, by Michael Stoll); following this repository's
convention for adapted material, the upstream authorship is credited here rather than in the
copyright header.

`IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.comapOfNeBot` and its projection are likewise adapted from that
formalisation (`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, `EllipticCurves/Mathlib/Basic.lean`
line 539, at the roadmap's pin `66889eada51a74c2f5dfb7fb5909b0b5a0a2d96e`, Apache 2.0, by Michael
Stoll). The construction is the source's; what changed is the hypothesis — the source and this
version take the nonvanishing of the contraction as a hypothesis, where Mathlib's
`HeightOneSpectrum.comap` instead derives it from surjectivity of the map.

`Ideal.ne_bot_of_comap_ne_bot` plays the role of the source's
`comap_ne_bot_of_comap_comap_ne_bot` (`EllipticCurves/Mathlib/Basic.lean` line 270): it is what
discharges that nonvanishing hypothesis when a prime is contracted through an intermediate ring.
It is stated here in the general form — an arbitrary ideal and an injective ring homomorphism,
with the map producing the ideal dropped, since it plays no role — and proved from Mathlib's
`Ideal.comap_bot_of_injective`.

/-- The height-one prime of `B` obtained by contracting a height-one prime of `C` along a ring
homomorphism `ψ : B →+* C`, given that the contraction is nonzero.

Mathlib's `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.comap` is the same construction, but it asks for `ψ`
to be **surjective** and derives the `ne_bot` field from that. `comapOfNeBot` **generalises** it:
the surjective case is recovered by supplying `(Ideal.eq_bot_of_comap_eq_bot' hf).mt w.ne_bot`, and
only the converse fails.

The generality is needed because the maps contracted along here are embeddings into completions —
`R → v.adicCompletionIntegers K` — which are neither surjective, so Mathlib's `comap` does not
apply, nor integral `Algebra` maps, so `HeightOneSpectrum.under` does not either. (`ℤ → ℤ_p` is
flat, not integral.) The `ne_bot` hypothesis has to be supplied by hand.

/-- The maximal ideal is the only height-one prime of a discrete valuation ring.

Mathlib has `IsDiscreteValuationRing.maximalIdeal` as a `HeightOneSpectrum` and
`IsLocalRing.eq_maximalIdeal` for ideals, but not that the two agree at the level of
`HeightOneSpectrum`. That identification is what lets a statement about the height-one primes of a
discrete valuation ring be read as a statement about its valuation. -/
-- Not `@[simp]`: the left-hand side is the bare variable `P`, so its head symbol is a variable and
-- the compiler rejects the annotation outright ("the theorem will be tried on every simp step").
