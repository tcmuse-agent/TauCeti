# The localisation of a Dedekind domain at a height-one prime, inside its fraction field

Let `O` be a Dedekind domain with fraction field `K` and let `v` be a height-one prime of `O`.
Mathlib's `IsLocalization.AtPrime.isDiscreteValuationRing_of_dedekind_domain` says that the
localisation `Oᵥ := Localization.AtPrime v.asIdeal` is a discrete valuation ring, as a theorem with
the nonzero-prime hypothesis explicit. This file records it as an instance for height-one primes,
which carry that hypothesis as `v.ne_bot`. Together with the `Algebra Oᵥ K`, `IsScalarTower O Oᵥ K`
and `IsFractionRing Oᵥ K` instances of `TauCeti/RingTheory/Localization/AtPrime.lean`, every result
Mathlib states over a discrete valuation ring `R` with fraction field `K` — in particular its theory
of integral and minimal Weierstrass equations — now applies to `Oᵥ ⊆ K` by instance search, for
arbitrary `O` and `K`.

The remaining results are the two bridges between `v` and `Oᵥ`. Downwards: an element of `K` that
comes from `Oᵥ` has `v`-adic valuation at most one; hence, by Mathlib's
`IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.mem_integers_of_valuation_le_one`, an element that comes from
every `Oᵥ` comes from `O`. The latter is `O = ⋂ᵥ Oᵥ` inside `K`, and is what lets a property that
holds over every localisation descend to `O`. The valuation bound is stated for any
`IsLocalization.AtPrime` model of `Oᵥ` mapping to `K` over `O`, not only for
`Localization.AtPrime v.asIdeal` itself.

Sideways: `Oᵥ` is exactly the ring of integers of the `v`-adic valuation, and the discrete
valuation `Oᵥ` carries as a discrete valuation ring — Mathlib's
`IsDiscreteValuationRing.maximalIdeal Oᵥ`, the phrasing of every statement it makes over a discrete
valuation ring — is the `v`-adic valuation itself. Without that identification a result proved at
`Oᵥ` cannot be compared with the `v`-adic factorisation of an element of `O`.
