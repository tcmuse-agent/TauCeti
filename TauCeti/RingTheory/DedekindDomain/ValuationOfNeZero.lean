# The `Multiplicative ℤ`-valued adic valuation of a unit

Mathlib attaches to a height one prime `v` of a Dedekind domain `R` a homomorphism
`v.valuationOfNeZero : Kˣ →* Multiplicative ℤ`, the `v`-adic valuation of a unit of the fraction
field read without the adjoined zero, and relates it to `v.valuation K` in one direction only:
`valuationOfNeZero_eq` coerces it into `ℤᵐ⁰`. This file supplies the two complements that make it
usable as a rewriting rule, together with two lemmas transporting it along a compatible pair of
embeddings of Dedekind domains and their fraction fields.

## Main results

* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.valuationOfNeZero_eq_iff`: the `Multiplicative ℤ`-valued
  valuation of a unit is determined by the `ℤᵐ⁰`-valued one.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.valuationOfNeZero_eq_one_iff`: its `m = 1` case, that a unit
  has trivial `v`-adic `valuationOfNeZero` exactly when its `v`-adic valuation is `1`.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.exists_valuationOfNeZero_map_eq`: along a pair of compatible
  embeddings `ψ : B →+* C` of Dedekind domains and `φ : L →+* N` of their fraction fields, the
  `w`-adic valuation of `φ u` is the valuation of `u` at the contracted prime raised to a fixed
  power — the ramification index of `w` over that contraction.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.dvd_toAdd_valuationOfNeZero_map`: consequently divisibility
  of the valuation by `n` transports along such an embedding. Only the *existence* of the exponent
  matters for that, which is why the exponent is left existentially quantified above.

## Implementation notes

These live in their own module rather than beside their first consumer. `valuationOfNeZero` is
declared in `Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/SelmerGroup.lean`, so any host must import that;
but the *generic* completion and `S`-integer APIs that need the two complements must not, in
consequence, also inherit this repository's Selmer-group development. Keeping them here lets
`TauCeti/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/AdicCompletionExtension.lean` use them without depending on
`TauCeti/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/SelmerGroup.lean`, which is downstream of it.

## Provenance

Michael Stoll's elliptic-curves formalisation
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, Apache 2.0, by Michael Stoll) at commit
`66889eada51a` reaches for a `HeightOneSpectrum.valuationOfNeZero_eq_iff`; no such lemma exists at
our Mathlib pin, so it is supplied here. `exists_valuationOfNeZero_map_eq` and
`dvd_toAdd_valuationOfNeZero_map` are adapted from the same source
(`EllipticCurves/Mathlib/Basic.lean`).

/-- Divisibility of adic valuations transports along compatible embeddings: if the valuation of
`u` at the contracted prime is divisible by `n`, so is the `w`-adic valuation of `φ u`.

This is the form in which the semilocal comparison of `2`-descent uses
`exists_valuationOfNeZero_map_eq`: ramification multiplies the valuation by a fixed factor, and
multiplication preserves divisibility, so parity — the case `n = 2` — survives in both
directions. -/
