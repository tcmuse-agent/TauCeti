# Complements on the `v`-adic valuation of a unit

Mathlib's `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.valuationOfNeZero` is the `v`-adic valuation
restricted to `Kˣ`, valued in `Multiplicative ℤ` rather than `ℤₘ₀`, and Mathlib relates it to
`valuation` only through the coercion `valuationOfNeZero_eq`. This file adds the triviality
criterion in the uncoerced form, and the corresponding criterion one level up, on the quotient
`Kˣ ⧸ (Kˣ)ⁿ` where the Selmer group `K⟮S, n⟯` lives: there triviality of `valuationOfNeZeroMod`
is divisibility by `n` of the valuation. That second criterion is what turns membership in
`IsDedekindDomain.selmerGroup` from a statement about a quotient into an arithmetic condition on
a representative.

## Main results

* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.valuationOfNeZeroMod_mk_eq_one_iff`: the class of a unit
  has trivial `v`-adic `valuationOfNeZeroMod n` exactly when `n` divides its `v`-adic valuation.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.dvd_toAdd_valuationOfNeZero`: if the `v`-adic valuation of
  a unit is the `n`-th power of that of another unit, then `n` divides its `v`-adic order.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.finite_setOfPred_valuation_ne_one`: a nonzero element has
  trivial valuation at all but finitely many primes.

Michael Stoll's elliptic-curves formalisation
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, at the `EllipticCurves` roadmap's pin
`66889eada51a`, Apache 2.0, by Michael Stoll) reaches for a
`HeightOneSpectrum.valuationOfNeZero_eq_iff` in this role; no such lemma exists at our Mathlib
pin, so it and its `m = 1` case `valuationOfNeZero_eq_one_iff` are supplied in
`TauCeti/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/ValuationOfNeZero.lean`, which this file imports — they are
generic, and the completion API needs them without needing the Selmer groups below.
`valuationOfNeZeroMod_mk_eq_one_iff`, `dvd_toAdd_valuationOfNeZero` and
`finite_setOfPred_valuation_ne_one` are adapted from that source's
`EllipticCurves/Mathlib/Basic.lean`. Following this repository's convention for adapted material,
the upstream authorship is credited here rather than in the copyright header.

/-- The class of a unit `u` in `Kˣ ⧸ (Kˣ)ⁿ` has trivial `v`-adic valuation mod `n` exactly when
`n` divides the `v`-adic valuation of `u`. Membership in `IsDedekindDomain.selmerGroup` is the
conjunction of these conditions over the primes away from `S`, so this is what expresses that
membership as an arithmetic condition on a representative. -/
