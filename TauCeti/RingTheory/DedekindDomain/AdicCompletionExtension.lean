# Extension of adic completions along an extension of Dedekind domains

Let `R` be a Dedekind domain with fraction field `K`, let `L/K` be an extension and `B` a
Dedekind domain with fraction field `L` extending `R`, and let `w` be a height-one prime of `B`
lying over the height-one prime `v` of `R`. Completing at `v` and at `w` gives fields `K_v` and
`L_w`, and the inclusion `K → L` extends continuously to a ring homomorphism `K_v →+* L_w`.

This file constructs that homomorphism, `adicCompletionExtension`, records that the valuation of
`L_w` restricted along it is the valuation of `K_v` raised to the ramification index, restricts it
to the rings of integers as `adicCompletionIntegersExtension`, and shows that the maximal ideal
contracts to the maximal ideal. It also provides the induced algebra structure in the
`AdicCompletionExtension` scope, and identifies the valuation attached to the maximal ideal of
`𝒪_v` — a discrete valuation ring — with the valuation of the completion itself, which is what
lets a statement about height-one primes of `𝒪_v` be read as a statement about `K_v`.

This is the local-to-global bridge of the explicit `2`-descent: comparing a square class of a
global étale algebra with its images in the completions passes through exactly these maps.

## Main definitions

* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.adicCompletionExtension`: the induced ring homomorphism
  `K_v →+* L_w`.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.adicCompletionExtensionAlgebra`: the algebra structure
  induced by that map, available in the `AdicCompletionExtension` scope.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.adicCompletionIntegersExtension`: its restriction
  `𝒪_v →+* 𝒪_w` to the rings of integers.

## Main results

* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.valuation_maximalIdeal_adicCompletionIntegers`: the
  valuation attached to the maximal ideal of `𝒪_v` is the valuation of `K_v`.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.valuation_adicCompletionIntegers`: the same identification
  at an arbitrary height-one prime of `𝒪_v`, for every element of `K_v`.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.valuationOfNeZero_maximalIdeal_adicCompletionIntegers` and
  `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.valuation_adicCompletion_algebraMap`: the two restrictions
  of it the square-class conditions of the `2`-descent are stated in — on units of `K`, and on the
  image of `K`.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.ringChar_residueField_adicCompletionIntegers_ne_two`: at a
  place not dividing `2`, the residue field of `𝒪_v` has odd characteristic.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.exists_unit_not_isSquare`: at such a place, with finite
  residue field, `𝒪_v` carries a unit that is not a square in `K_v`. This is the input the
  local image count at a good odd place needs.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.valued_adicCompletionExtension`: along the extension the
  valuation is raised to the ramification index.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.comap_maximalIdeal_adicCompletionIntegersExtension`: the
  maximal ideal of `𝒪_w` contracts to the maximal ideal of `𝒪_v`.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.continuous_adicCompletionExtension` and
  `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.eq_adicCompletionExtension_of_continuous`: the extension is
  continuous, and is the only continuous ring homomorphism `K_v →+* L_w` extending `K → L`. Together
  these are its universal property, usable without unfolding the definition.

## Motivation

Every result here is consumed by a semilocal comparison in explicit `2`-descent: matching the
unramifiedness of a square class at the primes of the field factors with unramifiedness over the
valuation ring of `K_v`. Nothing in this file mentions a curve — each statement is about a
Dedekind domain and one of its completions.

## Provenance

Adapted, with the authors' proofs, from Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves` project
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, Apache-2.0, pinned by
`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` at `66889eada51a`),
`EllipticCurves/Mathlib/AdicCompletionExtension.lean`.

That file in turn credits the FLT project
(`github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT`, `FLT/DedekindDomain/Completion/BaseChange.lean`, by
Kevin Buzzard, Andrew Yang and Matthew Jasper) for the completion-extension material, rebased
there onto Mathlib's `valuation_liesOver` and `uniformContinuous_algebraMap_liesOver`; the same
rebasing is used here, so both are credited.

`span_singleton_eq_maximalIdeal_pow` comes from that same Stoll file, restated here against this
repository's `HeightOneSpectrum` interface.

`exists_unit_not_isSquare` comes from the same source file (`:183`). Two deliberate departures from
its proof: the source contracts the maximal ideal with its own
`comap_maximalIdeal_adicCompletionIntegers`, which this repository states as
`under_maximalIdeal_adicCompletionIntegers` (`Ideal.under R I` is by definition
`I.comap (algebraMap R S)`); and where the source derives `v d = 1` from a square by manipulating
`WithZero.log`, this uses Mathlib's `mul_self_le_one_iff` and `one_le_mul_self_iff`, which say the
same thing about the ordered value monoid in one line. The odd-residue-characteristic step is split
out as `ringChar_residueField_adicCompletionIntegers_ne_two`, which the source keeps inline.

The Henselian and completeness chain from that same Stoll file lives in
`TauCeti.RingTheory.DedekindDomain.AdicValuation.Completion`, with the single-completion
valuation and residue-field results it rests on — among them
`residueFieldEquivAdicCompletionIntegers`, which this file uses.

## Implementation notes

Every Mathlib module this file needs arrives through
`TauCeti.RingTheory.DedekindDomain.AdicValuation.Completion`, which is imported for the
single-completion results and publicly re-exports them.

This is what lets a condition stated at the height-one primes of `𝒪_v` be read as a condition on

namespace AdjoinRoot

/-- The base-change map `K[X] ⧸ (p) →+* K_v[X] ⧸ (q)` of `AdjoinRoot`s at a completion is
compatible with the algebra maps from the underlying Dedekind domain `R` and from the ring of
integers of the completion. -/
-- Lives here rather than beside `AdjoinRoot.map` in `TauCeti.RingTheory.AdjoinRoot.Factors`
-- because it is not a fact about `AdjoinRoot` alone: it names `adicCompletion` and
-- `adicCompletionIntegers`, and this module is where those two developments first meet.
