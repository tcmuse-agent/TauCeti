# Evaluating a multivariate power series at arguments from an adic ideal

Let `S` carry the `I`-adic topology for an ideal `I`, and let `f` be a multivariate power series
evaluated at a family `a : σ → S` through a continuous coefficient map `φ`. This file bounds the
value `eval₂ φ a f` by a power of `I`, in the three forms the estimate is used in: the value is
confined to `I ^ k` as soon as the arguments are and `φ` sends the constant term there, and the
confinement improves when the series vanishes in low total degree or when `φ` sends every
coefficient into a power of `I`.

Three further results serve the same arguments from either side. Over finitely many variables a
pointwise topologically nilpotent family admits evaluation; arguments drawn from `I` satisfy
`MvPowerSeries.HasEval` in the first place, so that the value is defined at all; and the value is
congruent to the image of the constant term modulo `I`.

They are proved differently. `hasEval_of_finite_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent` does not use the
estimates above at all: over
finitely many variables the decay condition at infinity is vacuous, so topological nilpotence
of each argument is the whole content. `hasEval_of_mem` is its corollary, obtained by supplying
that nilpotence from membership in `I` through `IsAdic.isTopologicallyNilpotent_of_mem`.
`eval₂_sub_constantCoeff_mem` is the one that reduces to them — subtracting the constant term
kills the constant monomial and every surviving monomial carries an argument, so the difference
is the `k = 1` case of `eval₂_mem_pow` applied to `f - C (constantCoeff f)`.

The three bounds have the same one-line mechanism. `MvPowerSeries.hasSum_eval₂` writes the value
as the sum of its monomial values `φ (coeff d f) * ∏ s, a s ^ d s`; each such monomial is checked
to lie in the relevant power of `I`; and the sum of a family inside `I ^ n` stays inside `I ^ n`
because `I ^ n` is closed (`IsAdic.isClosed_pow`) and `tsum_mem` applies. The three statements
differ only in which power the monomial estimate produces.

Three hypotheses of the source turn out to be unnecessary. Nothing asks for `I` to be maximal or
for `S` to be local, only that the topology be `I`-adic, so the results are stated for an
arbitrary ideal; the coefficient map is an arbitrary continuous `φ : R →+* S` rather than the
identity, since `MvPowerSeries.hasSum_eval₂` is already stated at that generality; and the index
type need not be finite, because the summation argument uses only the `Tendsto a cofinite (𝓝 0)`
already carried by `HasEval`. Taking `I` to be `IsLocalRing.maximalIdeal S` and `φ` to be
`RingHom.id S` recovers the source statements.

Finiteness of `σ` survives in `hasEval_of_finite_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent`, where it is what
makes the decay condition of
`HasEval` vacuous; that is the one place the hypothesis does work, and `hasEval_of_mem` inherits
it from there.

## Main results

* `MvPowerSeries.eval₂_mem_pow` : arguments in `I ^ k`, and a constant term whose image under
  `φ` lies in `I ^ k`, confine the value to `I ^ k`.
* `MvPowerSeries.eval₂_mem_pow_mul` : a series vanishing below total degree `c`, evaluated at
  arguments of `I ^ j`, takes values in `I ^ (c * j)`.
* `MvPowerSeries.eval₂_mem_pow_add_mul` : if moreover `φ` sends every coefficient into `I ^ k`,
  the value lies in `I ^ (k + c * j)`.
* `MvPowerSeries.hasEval_of_finite_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent` : finitely many topologically
  nilpotent arguments are an
  admissible evaluation point.
* `MvPowerSeries.hasEval_of_mem` : a family of finitely many arguments drawn from `I` is an
  admissible evaluation point.
* `MvPowerSeries.eval₂_sub_constantCoeff_mem` : the value and the image of the constant term
  differ by an element of `I`.

## Provenance

Adapted from Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves` (`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`,
Apache-2.0) at commit `66889eada51a74c2f5dfb7fb5909b0b5a0a2d96e`, file
`EllipticCurves/WeierstrassFormalGroup/Eval.lean`, where the three bounds are
`ChabautyColeman.MvPSeries.eval_mem_maximalIdeal_pow`, `..._pow_mul` and `..._pow_add_mul`, and
`EllipticCurves/Mathlib/Chabauty/MvPSeries.lean`, where `hasEval_of_mem` carries the same name and
`eval₂_sub_constantCoeff_mem` is `ChabautyColeman.MvPSeries.eval_sub_constantCoeff_mem`. That
development evaluates through its own `ChabautyColeman.MvPSeries.eval`, which is by definition
`MvPowerSeries.eval₂ (RingHom.id _)`; the wrapper is dropped here and the statements are made
directly about Mathlib's `MvPowerSeries.eval₂`, as are the generalisations noted above. The
monomial estimates and the closed-ideal summation argument are the source's, as is the
`HasEval` construction. The congruence modulo `I` is not: the source proves it from the
`hasSum` expansion directly, whereas here it is the `k = 1` case of `eval₂_mem_pow` applied to
`f - C (constantCoeff f)`, which is shorter and needs no finiteness of `σ`.
