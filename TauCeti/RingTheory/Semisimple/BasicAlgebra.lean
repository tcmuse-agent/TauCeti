# Basic algebras

A ring `A` is **basic** when its quotient by the Jacobson radical, `A ⧸ Ring.jacobson A`, is a
finite product of division rings.  The definition states this as the quotient being *semisimple* and
*reduced*, which says the same thing (`TauCeti.isBasic_iff_pi_divisionRing`): Artin--Wedderburn
writes a semisimple ring as a finite product of matrix algebras over division rings, one block for
each simple module, and a matrix algebra of size at least two is never reduced, the matrix unit
`Eᵢⱼ` with `i ≠ j` being nonzero and square-zero.  So over a semisimple ring reducedness says
exactly that **every block has size one**, that is, that the ring is a product of division rings
rather than of matrix algebras over them; equivalently, that no indecomposable projective is
repeated in a decomposition of the regular module.

That reformulation is the main result.  Its ring-level form,
`TauCeti.isReduced_iff_pi_divisionRing`, holds for an arbitrary semisimple ring and mentions no
algebra structure.

The condition is aimed at a finite-dimensional algebra over a field, where the quotient by the
radical is semisimple because the algebra is Artinian.  Whenever that quotient is semisimple -- in
particular for every Artinian, or more generally semiprimary, ring -- the semisimplicity clause is
automatic and basicness is reducedness alone (`TauCeti.isBasic_iff_isReduced`).  Outside that
setting the clause has to be asked for: `ℤ` has zero Jacobson radical and is reduced, but is not a
product of division rings and is not a basic ring.

Basicness is the normalization step of Morita theory: every finite-dimensional algebra is Morita
equivalent to a basic one, obtained by keeping one indecomposable projective per simple module.
That reduction is not proved here.  The model example is on the quiver side: the path algebra of a
finite acyclic quiver is basic (`TauCeti.PathAlgebra.isBasic`).

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsBasic`: a ring whose quotient by the Jacobson radical is semisimple and reduced.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isBasic_def`: unfolding lemma for `TauCeti.IsBasic`.
* `RingEquiv.isBasic_iff`: basicness is invariant under a ring equivalence.
* `TauCeti.Matrix.isReduced_iff_subsingleton`: a matrix ring over a nonzero reduced semiring is
  reduced exactly when it has at most one index.
* `TauCeti.isReduced_iff_pi_divisionRing`: a semisimple ring is reduced if and only if it is a
  finite product of division rings.
* `TauCeti.isBasic_iff_pi_divisionRing`: a ring is basic if and only if its quotient by the
  Jacobson radical is a finite product of division rings.
* `TauCeti.isBasic_iff_isReduced`: a ring whose quotient by the Jacobson radical is semisimple is
  basic if and only if that quotient is reduced.
* `TauCeti.isBasic_of_commRing`: a commutative ring whose quotient by the Jacobson radical is
  semisimple is basic.

## Implementation notes

Mathlib's `Matrix.uniqueRingEquiv` fixes the `Fintype` structure on the one-element index type to
the one manufactured from `Unique`, so its type does not match a matrix ring formed with a `Fintype`
structure coming from elsewhere -- the two are equal but not definitionally so, and the
multiplication of a matrix ring depends on which one is used.  Both uses below therefore rewrite
along `Subsingleton.elim` first; the index types in question are a `Fin`-indexed one, as produced by
Artin--Wedderburn, and one carrying a `Fintype` hypothesis.

`TauCeti.IsBasic` keeps its body private; `TauCeti.isBasic_def` is the unfolding lemma through which
importing modules use the definition.

`TauCeti.IsBasic` takes only the ring, with no base field and no finite-dimensionality over it:
neither appears in the condition.  Dropping them is what puts semisimplicity of the quotient into
the definition: over a finite-dimensional algebra it is automatic, but for a general ring
reducedness alone is strictly weaker than being a product of division rings.  The formulation as
reducedness of the quotient is `TauCeti.isBasic_iff_isReduced`, which asks only for that
semisimplicity, as an instance.  A finite-dimensional algebra over a field supplies it through
`IsArtinianRing.of_finite` and the instances making an Artinian ring semiprimary and the quotient
of a semiprimary ring by its radical semisimple.
