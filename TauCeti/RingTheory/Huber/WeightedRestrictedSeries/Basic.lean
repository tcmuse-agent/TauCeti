# Weighted restricted power series `A⟨X⟩_T`

For a commutative nonarchimedean ring `A` and a family `T` of subsets of `A` indexed by the
variables, Wedhorn defines the *weighted* restricted power series ring

```text
A⟨X⟩_T := { ∑ aν Xν ∈ A[[X]] | aν ∈ Tν · U for every open subgroup U of A and almost all ν },
```

with the subgroups `U⟨X⟩ := { ∑ aν Xν ∈ A⟨X⟩_T | aν ∈ Tν · U for all ν }` as a fundamental
system of neighbourhoods of zero. Here `Tν := T₁^ν₁ ⋯ Tₖ^νₖ`. Taking every `Tᵢ = {1}` recovers
the ordinary restricted series `A⟨X⟩`.

**Both of those claims need Wedhorn's standing hypothesis** `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightFamily T`,
fixed at the start of his §5.6: without it `A⟨X⟩_T` is not multiplicatively closed and the
`U⟨X⟩` are not neighbourhoods of zero. The subring and topology constructions
(`weightedRestrictedSubring`, `weightedNhd`, `weightedTopology` and the maps into them) therefore
take it as an argument; the underlying weight operations `weightPow` and `weightMul` and the
predicate `IsWeightedRestricted` do not, since they are defined for any family. The
counterexample in `IsWeightFamily`'s docstring shows the hypothesis is not automatic.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Huber.weightPow`: the subset `Tν = T₁^ν₁ ⋯ Tₖ^νₖ` of `A`.
* `TauCeti.Huber.weightMul`: the additive subgroup `Tν · U`.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightFamily`: Wedhorn's standing hypothesis on `T` — for every variable `i`,
  every `m` and every neighbourhood `U` of zero, the subgroup `Tᵢ^m · U` is again one. The
  subring and the topology below are defined only under it.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightedRestricted`: Wedhorn's condition (5.6.1) on a power series.
* `TauCeti.Huber.weightedRestrictedSubring`: `A⟨X⟩_T` as a subring of `A[[X]]`.
* `TauCeti.Huber.weightedNhd`: the subgroup `U⟨X⟩` of `A⟨X⟩_T`.
* `TauCeti.Huber.weightedTopology`: the ring topology they generate. `A⟨X⟩_T` also carries the
  group uniformity of that topology, with its `IsUniformAddGroup` and
  `UniformContinuousConstSMul` instances, so that its separated completion can be formed.
* `TauCeti.Huber.weightedC` and `TauCeti.Huber.weightedX`: the constant series and the
  variables. `TauCeti.Huber.weightedC_injective`, with its `simp` form
  `TauCeti.Huber.weightedC_inj`, reads a constant series off its coefficient in degree `0`;
  `TauCeti.Huber.algebraMap_weightedRestrictedSubring_injective` and its product counterpart
  state the resulting injectivity for the canonical algebra maps.
* `TauCeti.Huber.weightedMap`: the morphism `A⟨X⟩_T → B⟨X⟩_S` induced by a continuous ring map
  carrying each weight into the corresponding one; `continuous_weightedMap` makes it a morphism of
  topological rings, and `weightedMap_id` with `weightedMap_comp` are the functor laws.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightFamily.of_exists_isOpenMap_mul`, with
  `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightFamily.of_exists_isUnit` and
  `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightFamily.of_forall_openAddSubgroup`: the three ways to supply the standing
  hypothesis. The first is the roadmap's openness phrasing, in the form the argument needs —
  multiplication by an element of `Tᵢ` an open *map*, not merely of open image.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightedRestricted.mul`: `A⟨X⟩_T` is closed under multiplication, the point
  Wedhorn flags as not entirely clear; with the additive closure lemmas this gives the subring.
  `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightedRestricted.finite_coeff_notMem` restates the predicate as finiteness of
  the exceptional set of coefficients.
* `TauCeti.Huber.weightedNhd_subgroups_basis`: the `U⟨X⟩` are a fundamental system of
  neighbourhoods of zero for a ring topology, with its contract
  (`hasBasis_nhds_zero_weightedTopology`, `isTopologicalRing_weightedTopology`,
  `nonarchimedeanRing_weightedTopology`, `continuous_weightedC`).
  `TauCeti.Huber.weightedC_mem_weightedNhd` records that a constant series meets the `U` bound as
  soon as its value does, and `TauCeti.Huber.isOpen_weightedNhd` that `U⟨X⟩` is open whenever `U`
  is.
* `TauCeti.Huber.weightedRestrictedSubring_one_weight`: for the trivial weight this is the ordinary
  ring of restricted power series (Wedhorn Example 5.54), with
  `TauCeti.Huber.subringCongr_one_weight_weightedX` and
  `TauCeti.Huber.subringCongr_one_weight_weightedC` saying where that identification sends the
  generators — to `restrictedX` and to the algebra map.
* `TauCeti.Huber.weightedPolynomials`, the polynomials as a subring of `A⟨X⟩_T`, with
  `mem_weightedPolynomials_iff` identifying it with finite support and the generators
  `weightedC`/`weightedX` in it; `TauCeti.Huber.dense_weightedPolynomials` is Wedhorn 5.49(1),
  read off the predicate-level `exists_mvPolynomial_forall_coeff_sub_mem`.
* `TauCeti.Huber.weightedPolynomialEquiv`, with `discreteTopology_weightedRestrictedSubring`
  and `weightedPolynomials_eq_top`: over a discrete ring the weighted topology is discrete and
  `A⟨X⟩_T` is exactly the polynomial ring.
* `TauCeti.Huber.weightedRestrictedSubring_fin_zero` and
  `TauCeti.Huber.weightedRestrictedSubringFinZeroEquiv`, with
  `continuous_weightedRestrictedSubringFinZeroEquiv` and its `_symm`: in no variables every
  series is restricted, so `A⟨X⟩_T` is `A` — and topologically so, since the index `Fin 0 →₀ ℕ`
  is a singleton and the basic neighbourhood is cut out by that one coefficient. All of them are
  stated for an arbitrary `T : Fin 0 → Set A` and take no weight-family hypothesis:
  `TauCeti.Huber.isWeightFamily_fin_zero` supplies it, the condition being a statement about each
  index and there being none.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightedRestricted.map`, with `weightMul_map_le` and `image_weightPow`:
  restrictedness is preserved by a continuous ring map carrying each `T i` into `S i`. This is
  what `weightedMap` is built from; `weightedMap_weightedX` says it fixes the variables, while
  `weightedMap_weightedC` says it acts as `φ` on constants — the constants are moved, not fixed.
  `weightedMap_id` and `weightedMap_comp` are the functor laws.

## Scope

Wedhorn states (5.6.1) for an arbitrary index set `I`. This file formalises the finite-variable
case `I = Fin k`, which is what the roadmap's Layer 0.4 target needs; an arbitrary-index version
would run the weight through `Finsupp.prod` over the (finite) support of `ν`.

## Implementation notes

`Tν · U` is read as the additive subgroup *generated by* the products `t * u`, not as the
pointwise product set. Wedhorn's own statement forces this: he asserts that the `U⟨X⟩` are a
fundamental system of neighbourhoods of zero for a *ring* topology, so each must be an additive
subgroup, and the pointwise set `{t * u}` is not closed under addition.

The predicate carries no nonarchimedean hypothesis, matching (5.6.1), but it only *means*
coefficient convergence when the open additive subgroups are a neighbourhood basis of zero — the
setting Wedhorn works in throughout §5.6. Without that it can be vacuous: over `ℝ` with its usual
topology the only open additive subgroup is `ℝ` itself, so every power series is `T`-restricted
for the trivial weight. `TauCeti.Huber.isWeightedRestricted_one_weight_iff` therefore assumes
`NonarchimedeanAddGroup` — the additive condition is what rules that vacuity out, and no
multiplicative structure of the topology enters its proof.

If some `Tᵢ` is empty and `νᵢ > 0` then `Tν` is empty and `Tν · U = ⊥`, so the condition forces
those coefficients to vanish; the closure lemmas below need no nonemptiness hypothesis.

This construction is not the same as retopologising the ordinary `A⟨X⟩` by transporting along a
substitution `X ↦ f X`: there the weight multiplies the coefficient rather than the
neighbourhood, and the carrier does not vary with `T`. Here the carrier itself depends on `T`.

Nor is it Mathlib's `MvPowerSeries.IsRestricted`, despite that also being a weighted condition.
Mathlib weights by a polyradius `c : σ → ℝ` over a *normed* ring, asking that
`‖coeff t f‖ * ∏ i, c i ^ t i` tend to `0` along the cofinite filter. A Huber ring's topology is
nonarchimedean but in general carries no norm, so no polyradius is available to state that
condition, and the weight family here is a family of *subsets* `Tᵢ ⊆ A` acting on neighbourhood
subgroups rather than a family of reals scaling coefficient norms. The two do agree at the
trivial weight when the norm is *ultrametric*: the balls `{a | ‖a‖ < r}` are then additive
subgroups, and every open subgroup contains one, so quantifying over all open subgroups is the
same as quantifying over the balls and the condition becomes `‖coeff ν f‖ → 0` along the
cofinite filter. Over a general normed ring they do not agree: over `ℝ`, as above, the condition
here is vacuous while Mathlib's still asks for `‖coeff ν f‖ → 0`. The unweighted predicate of
`TauCeti/RingTheory/Huber/Restricted/PowerSeries.lean` is a topological limit rather than a
condition on subgroups, and that file remarks on the comparison for it — in prose, not as a
proved declaration. Neither notion is a special case of the other in general.

The finite-family absorption fact the multiplicative arguments run on — finitely many fixed
elements are absorbed into their own targets by a single open subgroup — mentions no weight, so
it lives in `TauCeti/Topology/Algebra/Nonarchimedean/Absorption.lean`, built on Mathlib's
single-element `NonarchimedeanRing.left_mul_subset`.

Closure of `A⟨X⟩_T` under multiplication is the one non-obvious point of the construction —
Wedhorn writes "note that it is not entirely clear that `A⟨X⟩_T` is multiplicatively closed" — and
is `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightedRestricted.mul` here. It is exactly what the standing hypothesis is
for.

## Provenance

The *construction* is new. The roadmap designates AINTLIB as the existing source for this row, so
its `AdicSpaces` weighted-series and localisation files were checked first: they contain no
`A⟨X⟩_T`, and AINTLIB's `TateAlgebraWedhorn` is a different object — it retopologises the ordinary
`A⟨X⟩` by transporting along a substitution rather than letting the carrier depend on `T`.

The *proofs*, however, follow `TauCeti/RingTheory/Huber/Restricted/PowerSeries.lean`
(TauCetiProject/TauCeti#2348), which is itself AINTLIB-derived — and not only in API layout. In
particular `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightedRestricted.mul` follows the plan of `IsRestricted.mul` there:
choose `W` with `W · W ⊆ U`; take the finite sets of coefficients of `f` and `g` that fail the `W`
bound; find one open subgroup absorbing those finitely many bad coefficients into the target;
rule out the exceptional index set `(F + G_Z) ∪ (F_Z + G)`; and split each antidiagonal term by
whether neither, or exactly one, of its factors is bad.

What is new there is the weighting, and it is not cosmetic: the target `Tν · U` varies with the
index, so the absorbing subgroup has to work against a *family* of targets — which is what
`TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightFamily` is for and what
`NonarchimedeanRing.exists_openAddSubgroup_forall_mul_subset` was factored out to supply — and
the trichotomy has to land in `Tα · U` and `Tβ · U` separately before `mul_mem_weightMul_add`
recombines them at `α + β`. The unweighted proof needs none of that.

The API layout — the `isWeightedRestricted_zero/one/add/neg/mul` series, the subring with its
`mem_` lemma, and the algebra-map coercion — follows the same file.

/-- Wedhorn's standing hypothesis on the weight family, fixed at the start of his §5.6: for every
variable `i`, every `m`, and every neighbourhood `U` of zero, the subgroup `Tᵢ^m · U` is again a
neighbourhood of zero.

Without it `A⟨X⟩_T` is not multiplicatively closed. Take `A = ℚ_p⟨Y, Z⟩`, `T = {Y}`, `f = Z X`
and `g = ∑ₙ Yⁿ pⁿ Xⁿ`: both are `T`-restricted, but the `Xᵏ` coefficient of `f * g` is
`Z Yᵏ⁻¹ pᵏ⁻¹`, which never lies in `Tᵏ · A = Yᵏ A`. Note that there `A` is complete, Tate and
Huber and `T` is finite, bounded and power-bounded — so none of those conditions substitute for
this one. What fails is exactly that `Y A` is not open. -/

/-- **The openness form of the standing hypothesis.** If some element of each `T i` multiplies
open sets to open sets, the family is a weight family.

This is the constructor for the roadmap's phrasing, which asks that each `Tᵢ · A` be open. Open
*image* is not by itself enough: it says the subgroup generated by `{t · a}` is open, whereas the
standing hypothesis needs `Tᵢ^m · U` to be a neighbourhood of zero for arbitrarily small `U`, i.e.
that multiplication by `t` is an open *map*. The two coincide under an open mapping theorem —
Henkel's, the Layer 0.6 target — which is not available here, so the map form is taken as the
hypothesis and `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightFamily.of_exists_isUnit` is the case of it that needs no
such theorem. -/

One unit per index suffices — the other elements of `T i` are never used — and the existential
also carries the nonemptiness the statement needs: `(∅ : Set A) ^ m` is empty for `m > 0`, so the
subgroup it generates is `⊥`, a neighbourhood of zero only for the discrete topology.

At `k = 0` the coefficient index `Fin 0 →₀ ℕ` is a singleton: a series is its constant coefficient
and nothing else. So restrictedness is vacuous, and the basic neighbourhood cut out by a subgroup
`U` is exactly the series whose one coefficient lies in `U`, which is `U`.

Neither fact mentions the weight, so the whole section is stated for an arbitrary
`T : Fin 0 → Set A` — at `Fin 0` the only multi-index is `0`, and `weightMul T 0 U` is `U` for
every `T`. The weight-family hypothesis is not carried either: it quantifies over the index, so
`isWeightFamily_fin_zero` discharges it outright. -/

/-! ### The uniform structure

`A⟨X⟩_T` carries the group uniformity of its additive topological group, so that its separated
completion can be formed. As with `weightedTopology` there is no diamond to fear: Mathlib's
uniformity on `MvPowerSeries` (like its topology) lives in the scoped
`MvPowerSeries.WithPiTopology`, so nothing else registers a `UniformSpace` on this carrier. -/

The roadmap asks for functoriality as part of the §0.4 target; Wedhorn states the construction
(Remark and Definition 5.48) but numbers no separate result for the induced morphism, so this
carries no Wedhorn locator. The two weight families are given independently rather than taking
`S i := φ '' T i`, because the image of a weight family need not be one and the intended targets —
`S i` a bounded subset of `B` containing `φ '' T i` — are larger. -/
