# The completion `A⟨T/s⟩`

The separated completion of `Aₛ` under `locTopology` is Wedhorn's `A⟨T/s⟩`. It is a Huber ring,
and the universal property of `LocalizationTopology.UniversalProperty` extends across it for
complete Hausdorff targets.

## Main definitions

* `locUniformSpace P T s S` : the uniformity `locTopology` determines, packaged so that
  `UniformSpace.Completion S` can be written down.
* `toCompletionLoc P T s S` : the structure map `A → A⟨T/s⟩`.
* `localizationUniform P T s S` : the pair `localization`, transported to the topology
  `locUniformSpace` induces, so that no statement about `A⟨T/s⟩` carries the transport.
* `completionLocalization P T s S` : the pair of definition `A⟨T/s⟩` carries.

## Main results

* `locUniformSpace_toTopologicalSpace`: the topology `locUniformSpace` induces is `locTopology`.
  This is what a proof rewrites against, so no body in this file needs exposing.
* `locUniformSpace_congr`: presentations sharing a ring of definition share the uniformity, so
  the two completions `A⟨T/s⟩` are the same object.
* `toCompletionLoc_heq`: the two structure maps `A → A⟨T/s⟩` into them agree. This is what
  `locUniformSpace_congr` alone does not give — it identifies only the codomains — and it is what
  a statement about the maps *out of* `A⟨T/s⟩` needs before it can be carried between
  presentations. The maps out of it remain a further question.
* `isUniformAddGroup_locUniformSpace` and `isTopologicalRing_locUniformSpace`: the two companions
  of `locUniformSpace`. Since `locTopology` is not an instance, a statement about `A⟨T/s⟩` has to
  name its structures; these three declarations are what it names.
* `localizationUniform_ringOfDefinition` and `mem_localizationUniform_idealOfDefinition`, with
  `completionLocalization_ringOfDefinition` and `mem_completionLocalization_idealOfDefinition`:
  the completed pair's API, reducing to the concrete `D` and `J`.
* `continuous_toCompletionLoc`: the structure map `A → A⟨T/s⟩` is continuous.
* `isHuberRing_completion_locTopology`: `A⟨T/s⟩` is a Huber ring — the completed pair above is a
  pair of definition for it.
* `isTateRing_completion_locTopology_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent`: a topologically nilpotent
  denominator becomes a pseudouniformiser, so the completed localization is Tate.
* `isTateRing_completion_locTopology_of_isTateRing`: over a Tate base the completed localization
  is Tate for every denominator.
* `existsUnique_continuous_ringHom_completion_locTopology`: the universal property, for complete
  Hausdorff targets.
* `completion_locTopology_ringHom_ext_of_continuous`: two continuous ring homomorphisms out of
  `A⟨T/s⟩` agreeing on `A` are equal, so a map out of `A⟨T/s⟩` is determined by its restriction to
  `A`. Unlike the universal property this needs no hypothesis on `s` or the fractions — those
  govern which maps exist, not when two agree — and its target need only be a semiring carrying a
  Hausdorff topology.
* `eq_id_of_comp_toCompletionLoc_eq_self` and `eq_comp_of_comp_toCompletionLoc_eq`: two
  corollaries of the previous item, saying that a continuous map compatible with the structure
  maps is forced to be the identity, respectively the composite. These are **not** roadmap Layer
  3.1's identity and composition laws for restriction maps: no restriction map is constructed
  here, and these are conditional uniqueness statements about whatever compatible maps happen to
  exist. They are what those laws will be proved *from* once the restriction maps themselves are
  built.

## Provenance

`A⟨T/s⟩` and its universal property are this repository's own, built on the localisation topology
of `LocalizationTopology.Basic`, which is the AINTLIB port — see that module's Provenance section
for the source file and commit.

## References

* [T. Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*][wedhorn_adic], Proposition and Definition 5.51, §5.6
* `Mathlib.Topology.Algebra.Valued.ValuationTopology`, `Valued.mk'` — the model for the instance
  setup here. It layers `IsTopologicalAddGroup.rightUniformSpace` and
  `isUniformAddGroup_of_addCommGroup` on a topology built from a `RingSubgroupsBasis`, passing
  that topology positionally because it is not an instance; `locTopology` is in the same position.

/-! ### The completion `A⟨T/s⟩` -/

/-- **The canonical uniformity on `Aₛ`**, the one its topology determines.

`locTopology` is not an instance, so a consumer of the completion has to name the uniform structure
explicitly. This packages the construction, and it takes **three** declarations to state anything
about `A⟨T/s⟩`: `locUniformSpace` makes `UniformSpace.Completion S` well-formed,
`isUniformAddGroup_locUniformSpace` makes the completion an additive group, and
`isTopologicalRing_locUniformSpace` is what its ring structure is inferred from. The first two
alone do not suffice.

`locUniformSpace_toTopologicalSpace` is the characteristic property — the topology it induces is
`locTopology` — so the body is not exposed and a proof rewrites against that lemma instead.

It is *the* uniformity, not merely one compatible with the topology:
`IsUniformAddGroup.rightUniformSpace_eq` identifies it with any uniformity making `Aₛ` a uniform
additive group, so a consumer arriving with its own such structure rewrites rather than
transports. -/

This is `TauCeti.completion_localization_ringHom_ext_of_continuous` at `Submonoid.powers s`. The
bridge it crosses is the unexported body of `toCompletionLoc`, namely
`UniformSpace.Completion.coeRingHom.comp (algebraMap A S)`: reassociating that composition turns
`g.comp (toCompletionLoc …)` into `(g.comp coeRingHom).comp (algebraMap A S)`, which is the
hypothesis that lemma takes. Nothing is unfolded at the level of coercions — the argument stays
with bundled `RingHom`s throughout. Crossing the unexported body once here keeps it out of every
consumer. -/

/-- **The universal property of `A⟨T/s⟩`**, for complete Hausdorff targets: a ring homomorphism
`φ : A →+* B` continuous at zero, with `φ s` a unit and each fraction `φ t / φ s` power-bounded,
extends to the completion in exactly one continuous way.

The hypotheses are those of `existsUnique_continuous_ringHom_locTopology` together with `B`
complete and separated, which is what an extension across the completion requires. As there, the
condition on the fractions is sufficient and is not claimed to be necessary. -/

/-- **The identity law.** A continuous ring endomorphism of `A⟨T/s⟩` fixing the structure map from
`A` is the identity, since the identity fixes it too.

As with the composition law below, this constructs no restriction map: it says that at most one
continuous endomorphism is compatible with the structure map, and names it. -/

/-- **The composition law.** If `g` carries the structure map of `A⟨T/s⟩` to a map `φ'`, and `h`
carries `φ'` on to `φ''`, then any continuous `k` carrying the structure map to `φ''` is `h.comp g`.

Only the *source* is a completed localisation — that is where extensionality is applied — so the
middle and target objects are arbitrary topological semirings, with `φ'` and `φ''` the ring
homomorphisms out of `A` they are equipped with. At the roadmap's intended instance these are the
completed localisations of two further presentations and their structure maps, but nothing here
requires that, and no restriction map is constructed: this is a uniqueness statement about maps
compatible with the structure maps, not Layer 3.1's composition law for restriction maps. -/
