# Bounded subsets of a topological ring

A subset `S` of a topological monoid with zero is *bounded* when every neighbourhood `U` of zero
absorbs `S`: there is a neighbourhood `V` of zero with `V * S ⊆ U`. This is the notion of
boundedness underlying Huber's theory of adic spaces (Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*, Definition 5.27),
where it is the condition cutting out the rings of definition of a Huber ring.

## Provenance

`IsBounded` and the elementary calculus — `IsBounded.subset`, `isBounded_empty`,
`isBounded_singleton_zero`, `isBounded_pair_zero_one`, `IsBounded.union`, `IsBounded.mul`,
`isBounded_singleton` and `isBounded_finite` — follow William Coram's mathlib4#40013, as do
several of their proofs. Everything else here is new: `isBounded_iUnion`, the nonarchimedean
`IsBounded.addSubgroupClosure`, `IsBounded.add` and `isBounded_sup`, and the image and transport
lemmas. The selection and ordering of results follows AINTLIB's `Bounded.lean`; its proofs were
not used.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Huber.IsBounded`: `S` is bounded, i.e. every neighbourhood of zero absorbs `S`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Huber.isBounded_iff`: unfolding lemma for `IsBounded`.
* `TauCeti.Huber.isBounded_finsetProd`: a finite pointwise product of bounded sets is bounded.
* `TauCeti.Huber.isBounded_finite`: finite sets are bounded.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsBounded.union`, `TauCeti.Huber.IsBounded.mul`: unions and pointwise products
  of bounded sets are bounded.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsBounded.add`, `TauCeti.Huber.IsBounded.addSubgroupClosure`: over a ring with a
  nonarchimedean additive group, sums and the generated additive subgroup of bounded sets stay
  bounded.
* `TauCeti.Huber.isBounded_sup`: the join of two bounded subrings of a commutative ring is
  bounded — the boundedness input for joins of rings of definition.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsBounded.image`: a morphism continuous at zero which is open at zero preserves
  boundedness, and `TauCeti.Huber.isBounded_image_ringEquiv_iff` transports boundedness along a
  topological ring isomorphism.

## Implementation notes

This is not Mathlib's `Bornology.IsVonNBounded`. That predicate asks that every neighbourhood of
zero *absorb* `S` after dilation by a norm-large scalar, so it needs a `SeminormedRing` of scalars
to have a bornology to be cofinal in; a Huber ring such as `ℤ_[p]⟦T⟧` with its `(p, T)`-adic
topology carries no such norm. The two notions agree over a nontrivially normed field acting on
itself, but neither the statement shape (`∃ V ∈ 𝓝 0, V * S ⊆ U` against
`∀ᶠ a in cobounded, S ⊆ a • U`) nor the hypotheses transfer.

Boundedness is *not* preserved by an arbitrary continuous homomorphism: giving `ℚ_[p]` the
discrete topology makes every subset bounded, while the identity to the `p`-adic topology is
continuous and `ℚ_[p]` is not bounded in itself. `IsBounded.image` therefore carries the extra
hypothesis that the morphism maps neighbourhoods of zero to neighbourhoods of zero.
