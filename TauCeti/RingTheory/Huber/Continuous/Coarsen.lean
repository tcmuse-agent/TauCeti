# Continuity of a vertical generization

**Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1), Remark 7.11(2).**

A vertical generization `v/H` of a continuous valuation on a Huber ring is again continuous. The
cofinality half of the argument is topology-free and lives in
`TauCeti.RingTheory.Valuation.Coarsen` as `Valuation.cofinalValue_coarsenByUnits_restrict`.
Wedhorn states the hypothesis as `H ⊊ Γ_v`: the convex subgroup is proper **in the value group**,
not in the ambient codomain. That is why the coarsening here is applied to `v.restrict`, which is
the presentation of `v` on its own value group; `H ≠ ⊤` is then literally Wedhorn's properness.

Properness is not decoration. If `H` were all of `Γ_v` the coarsening would take only the values
`0` and `1`, so `{a | w a < w b}` would be the support of `v`, and continuity would force that
support to be open — which it need not be.

## Main results

* `Valuation.IsContinuous.coarsenByUnits_restrict`: the coarsening of a continuous valuation by a
  proper convex subgroup of its value group is continuous.
