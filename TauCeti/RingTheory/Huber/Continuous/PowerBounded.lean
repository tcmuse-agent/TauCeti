# A continuous archimedean valuation is bounded by one on the power-bounded elements

**Wedhorn Proposition 7.41.** If `v` is a continuous valuation whose value group is
archimedean, and some topologically nilpotent `b` has `v b ≠ 0`, then `v a ≤ 1` for every
power-bounded `a`.

The two hypotheses on `v` are what Wedhorn's `x ∈ Cont(A)ᵃ of height 1` supplies. The
archimedean condition is imposed on the **value group** `MonoidWithZeroHom.ValueGroup₀ v`, not on
the codomain, which is what Mathlib's `Valuation.nonempty_rankOne_iff_mulArchimedean` actually
yields from height one; a caller who happens to have an archimedean codomain gets the instance by
`MulArchimedean.comap embedding.toMonoidHom embedding_strictMono`. The archimedean step therefore
runs in `Γ_v` and transports back along the strictly monotone embedding. Analyticity gives the
topologically nilpotent `b` with `v b ≠ 0`, which is Wedhorn's Remark 7.40(1).

The argument is Wedhorn's. Suppose `1 < v a`. Archimedeanness gives `n` with
`(v b)⁻¹ ≤ v a ^ n`, hence `1 ≤ v (a ^ n * b)`. But `a ^ n` is power-bounded and `b` is
topologically nilpotent, so `a ^ n * b` is topologically nilpotent, and continuity forces
`v (a ^ n * b) < 1`. The two bounds are incompatible, so no such `a` exists.

## Main results

* `Valuation.IsContinuous.le_one_of_isPowerBounded`: Proposition 7.41. Stated in the
  `Valuation.IsContinuous` namespace so it is reachable by dot notation on the continuity
  hypothesis, alongside `Valuation.IsContinuous.lt_one_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent`.

  this follows step by step, together with Remark 7.40(1) for the witness `b` and Proposition

/-- **Wedhorn Proposition 7.41.** A continuous valuation whose value group is archimedean, and
which is nonzero on some topologically nilpotent element, is bounded by `1` on the power-bounded
elements.

The archimedean hypothesis is on the value group, which is what height one supplies; an
archimedean codomain gives it by `MulArchimedean.comap`.

The witness `b` is what analyticity supplies (Wedhorn Remark 7.40(1)), and it is not removable.
Give a *reduced* `A` the discrete topology: every element is then power-bounded, every valuation
is continuous (`Valuation.isContinuous_of_discreteTopology`), and a power of `x` vanishes only if
`x` does, so `0` is the sole topologically nilpotent element and no witness exists. Discrete `ℚ`
carrying a `p`-adic valuation is such an `A`, and there `1 < v p⁻¹` refutes the conclusion. -/
