# Evaluating a weighted restricted power series

Wedhorn's universal property of `A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩_T` (Proposition 5.50) sends a `T`-restricted series
to the sum of its terms at a chosen tuple `b`. Before there is a map to speak of, that sum has to
exist, and this file supplies exactly that: the family of terms is summable.

Summability is where the defining condition earns its keep. `T`-restrictedness says that for each
open subgroup `U` of `A`, all but finitely many coefficients lie in `Tν · U`; so all but finitely
many terms lie in `(φ(Tν) · bν) · φ(U)`. If the weighted monomials `φ(Tν) · bν` stay inside one
bounded set — `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightBounded` below, which is Wedhorn's hypothesis that the
variables are power-bounded *relative to the weights* — then shrinking `U` shrinks every one of
those terms at once, so the terms tend to zero along the cofinite filter. That convergence is the
*necessary* condition, not yet the sufficient one: it is completeness of the target that upgrades
it to summability, through Mathlib's
`NonarchimedeanAddGroup.summable_of_tendsto_cofinite_zero`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Huber.weightedEvalTerm`: the term `φ(coeff ν f) · bν` of the evaluation.
* `TauCeti.Huber.weightedVar` and `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightedVarPowerBounded`: Wedhorn's own
  coordinatewise hypothesis — each weighted variable `φ(Tᵢ) · bᵢ` is power-bounded as a set.
* `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightBounded`: the weighted monomials `φ(Tν) · bν` form a bounded set. This is
  the hypothesis the summability proof uses, and
  `TauCeti.Huber.isWeightBounded_of_isWeightedVarPowerBounded` derives it from the coordinatewise
  one for an arbitrary `T`. At the one-weight family it is *equivalent* to each `bᵢ` being
  power-bounded, which is Wedhorn's condition —
  `TauCeti.Huber.isWeightBounded_one_weight_iff_forall_isPowerBounded`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Huber.tendsto_weightedEvalTerm_cofinite_zero`: the terms tend to zero along the
  cofinite filter. This is the analytic input, and it needs no completeness.
* `TauCeti.Huber.summable_weightedEvalTerm`: completeness upgrades that convergence to
  summability.
* `TauCeti.Huber.summable_weightedEvalTerm_of_isWeightedVarPowerBounded`: the same stated with
  Wedhorn's coordinatewise hypothesis, for an arbitrary weight family.
* `TauCeti.Huber.summable_weightedEvalTerm_of_forall_isPowerBounded`: its one-weight reading, where
  the hypothesis is that each variable is power-bounded.

This file proves only the summability that the evaluation needs. The evaluation map itself is
`TauCeti.Huber.weightedEval` in `WeightedEval/Map.lean`, its packaging as a ring homomorphism is
`TauCeti.Huber.weightedEvalHom` in `WeightedEval/Hom.lean`, and its continuity is
`TauCeti.Huber.continuous_weightedEvalHom` in `WeightedEval/Continuous.lean`. The uniqueness that
makes Proposition 5.50 a universal property is
`TauCeti.Huber.weightedRestrictedSubring_ringHom_ext_of_continuous` in
`WeightedRestrictedSeries/Basic.lean`. `WeightedEval/UniversalProperty.lean` assembles the two
into an `∃!`, and states Proposition 5.50 itself — under Wedhorn's own coordinatewise
hypothesis — as
`existsUnique_continuous_ringHom_weightedRestrictedSubring_of_isWeightedVarPowerBounded`.

This is Wedhorn's requirement that the variables be power-bounded *relative to the weights*, in
the form the summability argument uses. It is a condition on the whole family rather than on each
`bᵢ` separately, because the bound has to be uniform in `ν`. For the one-weight family `T ≡ {1}`
it is equivalent to each `bᵢ` being power-bounded, which is Wedhorn's condition: every monomial
`bν` lies in the pointwise product of the power-sets, and a finite pointwise product of bounded
sets is bounded. -/
