# Formal logarithmic derivatives of power series

For a power series `f` with constant coefficient one, Mathlib's `PowerSeries.logOf f` is the
formal expansion of `log f`. This file defines its formal derivative and records the
characteristic identity

`logDeriv f * f = derivative f`.

Thus over a field it is the usual quotient `f' / f`. The multiplicative identity is more general:
it needs only a commutative ring over the rationals, because the constant coefficient one makes
`f - 1` a valid substitution into the logarithm series.

## Main definitions

* `PowerSeries.logDeriv`: the formal derivative of `PowerSeries.logOf`.
* `PowerSeries.coeff_logDeriv`: the coefficient formula for the formal logarithmic derivative.
* `PowerSeries.logDeriv_mul`: the product identity characterizing the logarithmic derivative.
* `PowerSeries.logDeriv_eq_derivative_mul_inv`: the quotient form over a field.
