# Coderivations of the reduced tensor coalgebra

For an `R`-module `M`, the reduced tensor words `⨁_{n ≥ 1} M^{⊗n}` carry the reduced
deconcatenation coproduct `Δ` built in `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.deconcatenation`.  A
*coderivation* is a linear endomorphism `b` satisfying the co-Leibniz rule
`Δ ∘ b = (b ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ b) ∘ Δ`.  This file proves that coderivations are exactly their Taylor
components: composing with the projection `letter` onto single letters is a linear isomorphism
from the coderivations onto the linear maps `⨁_{n ≥ 1} M^{⊗n} ⟶ M`.

That coderivations are *determined* by their Taylor components is an induction along the
conilpotence filtration: a word of length at most `n + 1` is cut into two words of length at most
`n`, so the right-hand side of the co-Leibniz rule is already known by induction, and a tensor word
is determined by its cut together with its letter.  That *every* family of components occurs is the
explicit Taylor expansion `coderiv`, which collapses each nonempty block of letters of a word to the
single letter the components produce from that block.  Verifying its co-Leibniz rule is a
reindexing: on both sides the summands are indexed by a cut position together with a collapsed
block, and a cut never splits a block nor the letter that replaced one.

This is the encoding in which an `A∞` algebra is a square-zero coderivation of the bar coalgebra of
a suspended graded module, and its Taylor components are the operations `m_n`; that use is
downstream, in the `DGAInfinity` roadmap.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.IsCoderivation`: the co-Leibniz rule.
* `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.coderiv`: the coderivation with prescribed Taylor components.
* `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.coderivations`: the submodule of coderivations.
* `LinearMap.taylorComponent`: the arity component of a linear endomorphism of reduced tensor
  words.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.IsCoderivation.eq_of_letter_comp_eq`: a coderivation is determined by
  its Taylor components.
* `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.isCoderivation_coderiv` and
  `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.letter_comp_coderiv`: `coderiv F` is a coderivation with Taylor
  components `F`.
* `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.coderivEquivTaylor`: coderivations are linearly isomorphic to their
  Taylor components.
* `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.IsCoderivation.eq_zero_iff_taylorComponent_eq_zero`: a coderivation
  vanishes exactly when all of its arity components vanish.
