# Coalgebra morphisms of reduced tensor coalgebras

For `R`-modules `M` and `N`, a linear map `F : Tᶜ(M) ⟶ Tᶜ(N)` between the reduced tensor
coalgebras `⨁_{n ≥ 1} M^{⊗n}` and `⨁_{n ≥ 1} N^{⊗n}` is a *coalgebra morphism* when it commutes
with reduced deconcatenation: `Δ ∘ F = (F ⊗ F) ∘ Δ`.  This file proves the concrete correspondence
between coalgebra morphisms `Tᶜ(M) ⟶ Tᶜ(N)` and their families of Taylor components, obtained by
composing with the projection `Tᶜ(N) ⟶ N` onto single letters.

That a coalgebra morphism is *determined* by its Taylor components is an induction along the
conilpotence filtration, exactly as for coderivations.  That *every* family `f` of components
occurs is the Taylor expansion `coalgHom f`, which sends a word `x₁ ⋯ xₙ` to the sum, over all
ways of cutting it into consecutive nonempty blocks `B₁ ⋯ B_k`, of the word
`f(B₁) ⋯ f(B_k)`.  It is built recursively by splitting off the first block,
`coalgHom f (x₁ ⋯ xₙ) = f(x₁ ⋯ xₙ) + ∑_{0 < d < n} f(x₁ ⋯ x_d) · coalgHom f (x_{d+1} ⋯ xₙ)`,
where `·` prepends a letter to a word (`ReducedTensorWords.prepend`).  Deconcatenating a
prepended word either separates the new letter or cuts the remaining word, which is what makes the
coalgebra-morphism identity an induction on the length of the word.

No sign enters: a coalgebra morphism of a bar construction has degree zero, so this ungraded
correspondence is the one describing `A∞` morphisms through their components `f_n`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.IsCoalgHom`: a linear map commuting with reduced deconcatenation.
* `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.coalgHom`: the coalgebra morphism with prescribed Taylor components.
* `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.coalgHomEquivTaylor`: coalgebra morphisms are in bijection with
  their Taylor components.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.coalgHom_subword`: the recursive evaluation rule of `coalgHom f`.
* `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.isCoalgHom_coalgHom` and
  `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.letter_comp_coalgHom`: `coalgHom f` is a coalgebra morphism with
  Taylor components `f`.
* `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.IsCoalgHom.eq_of_letter_comp_eq`: a coalgebra morphism is determined
  by its Taylor components.
* `TauCeti.ReducedTensorWords.coalgHom_comp_letter`: the letterwise map of a linear map is the
  coalgebra morphism whose only nonzero Taylor component is that map in arity one.
