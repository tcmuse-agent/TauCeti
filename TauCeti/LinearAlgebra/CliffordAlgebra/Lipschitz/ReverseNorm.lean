# The reverse norm of the Lipschitz group

A Clifford algebra carries two anti-involutions that fix the scalars: the reversion `reverse`,
which fixes every vector, and Mathlib's `star = reverse ∘ involute`, which negates every vector.
Each gives a norm on the Lipschitz group. The `star` norm `lipschitzNorm` takes the value `-Q v`
on a vector `v`. This file develops the `reverse` norm `x ↦ reverse x * x`, which takes the
value `Q v` on the nose, so a spinor norm defined through it sends the reflection in `v` to the
square class of `Q v` rather than of `-Q v`.

The two norms agree on even elements and differ by the sign `(-1) ^ r` on a product of `r`
vectors. Since the square class of `-1` is in general nontrivial, they genuinely differ on odd
Lipschitz elements. Mathlib's Pin and Spin groups are cut out by the `star` norm. On the even
part the two norms agree, so the Spin group is exactly the set of even Lipschitz elements of
reverse norm one.

## Main results

* `CliffordAlgebra.reverse_prod_map_ι_mul_prod_map_ι`: the reverse norm of a product of vectors
  is the product of their quadratic norms.
* `CliffordAlgebra.star_mul_self_eq_reverse_mul_self_of_mem_even` and
  `CliffordAlgebra.star_mul_self_eq_neg_one_pow_smul_reverse_mul_self`: the two norms agree on
  even elements and differ by `(-1) ^ r` on a product of `r` vectors.
* `CliffordAlgebra.cliffordNorm`: the unit-valued reverse norm on the Lipschitz group, with its
  defining equation `CliffordAlgebra.reverse_mul_self_eq_algebraMap_cliffordNorm`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.cliffordNorm_unitι`: a vector `v` with unit `Q v` has reverse norm `Q v`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.cliffordNorm_eq_sq_mul_of_coe_eq_algebraMap_mul`: rescaling by a scalar unit
  `c` multiplies the reverse norm by `c ^ 2`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.cliffordNorm_scalarUnits`: a scalar unit has reverse norm equal to its square.
* `CliffordAlgebra.lipschitzNorm_eq_cliffordNorm_of_mem_even` and
  `CliffordAlgebra.lipschitzNorm_eq_neg_cliffordNorm_of_mem_odd`: the comparison with the
  `star` norm on the Lipschitz group.
* `CliffordAlgebra.mem_spinGroup_iff_mem_even_and_cliffordNorm_eq_one`: the Spin group consists
  of the even Lipschitz elements of reverse norm one.
* `CliffordAlgebra.exists_scalarUnits_mul_mem_spinGroup_iff`: a Lipschitz element rescales by a
  scalar unit into the Spin group exactly when it is even and its reverse norm is a square.
