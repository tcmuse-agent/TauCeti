# The grading of a symmetric algebra

Let `M` be a module over a commutative semiring. The powers of the image of `M` in its symmetric
algebra are not merely a spanning family: they form an internal direct sum. Thus every element of
the symmetric algebra has a unique finite decomposition into homogeneous terms.

Consequently a map out of the symmetric algebra can be studied degree by degree: it is determined
by its restrictions to the homogeneous pieces, so two such maps agreeing on all of them agree, and
if it carries each piece into a corresponding summand of an internal decomposition of its target,
then it is injective as soon as all of those restrictions are.

Directness comes from the universal property: the external direct sum of the homogeneous pieces is
again a commutative algebra, so sending a generator to its degree-one copy produces an algebra map
splitting the recomposition map. No freeness of `M` is needed. This argument follows Mathlib's
`TensorAlgebra.gradedAlgebra`, in `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/TensorAlgebra/Grading.lean`, which grades
the tensor algebra the same way.

## Main results

* `gradedAlgebra`: the homogeneous pieces grade the symmetric algebra, so in particular they
  decompose it.
