# Chains with simple or double edges

The diagrams that the classification of finite-type Cartan matrices has to weigh are built out of
**chains**. This file isolates the entry functions for a simply-laced chain and for a chain whose
last edge may be double, together with the summation identities used by weighting arguments.

Nothing here mentions `TauCeti.IsFiniteType`, which is why the file sits above the finite-type
directory rather than in it. It exists because the diagrams that carry the length constraints of
the classification - the stars of `TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.FiniteType.Star.Basic`, the
double-edge chains of `TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.FiniteType.DoubleEdge.Basic`, and the
forked double-edge diagrams of `TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.FiniteType.ForkedDoubleEdge` -
are all assembled from chains and are all excluded by a vector that is linear along each chain
they contain. The simply-laced entry function and row sum are the special case `L = 0` of their
type-`B` counterparts.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.chainEntry`: the Cartan-matrix entry of a chain between two positions along it.
* `TauCeti.chainBEntry`: the Cartan-matrix entry of a chain whose last edge may be double.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.chainEntry_eq_cartanMatrix_A`: a chain of `n` positions is Mathlib's Cartan matrix of
  type `Aₙ`, which is what makes the name of the entry function the right one.
* `TauCeti.sum_range_chainEntry_mul`: the row of a chain at a position, evaluated at a weight `g`.
  Away from the two ends it is the second difference `2 g (m + 1) - g m - g (m + 2)`, so a weight
  that is linear in the position is annihilated there.
* `TauCeti.sum_range_chainEntry_mul_affine`: the resulting formula for an affine weight.
* `TauCeti.sum_range_chainBEntry_mul`: the corresponding row sum with a double last edge.
## References

The chain weighting is the calculation of J. E. Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie Algebras and
Representation Theory*, §11.4, and Bourbaki, *Lie Groups and Lie Algebras, Chapters 4-6*, Ch. VI §4.

/-- The Cartan-matrix entry of a **chain of type `B`** between the positions `s` and `t`, the last
position being `L`: `2` on the diagonal, `-1` between consecutive positions, and `-2` from the
position before `L` to `L` itself, whose root is the short one.

A value of `L` outside the range of positions describes a simply-laced chain, of type `A`; `L = 0`
is the convenient such value, since no position is the successor of `0`. -/

The entry at `(a, s)` contributes only when `s` is `a`, its predecessor, or its successor, and the
successor contribution is doubled at the short end.

The identity is pointwise in `s`: it mentions neither the summation range of the row it is used in
nor any bound on `a`. The last position `L` does appear, in the doubled coefficient at the short
end. -/

term `g m` being absent at `m = 0` and the term `g (m + 2)` at the far end. A weight that is linear
in the position is therefore annihilated away from the two ends.

The offset by one in the argument of `g` leaves room for a further vertex at the position `0`,
which is how both diagrams that consume this identity attach a chain to the rest of themselves.

Only the ring operations and the integer cast of the entries are used, so the weight may take its
values in any ring; the diagrams weigh their vertices by rational numbers. -/
