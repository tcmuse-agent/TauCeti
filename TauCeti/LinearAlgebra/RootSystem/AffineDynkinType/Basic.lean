# Affine simply-laced Dynkin diagrams

The simply-laced affine diagrams carry one node more than the corresponding finite simply-laced
diagram. Throughout this file a name such as `Aₙ` or `E₆` refers to the *affine* diagram, matching
the constructors below.

This file introduces the diagrams as an enumeration `TauCeti.AffineDynkinType`, attaches to each
its node count, its underlying `SimpleGraph` on `Fin t.nodes`, and its generalized Cartan matrix,
and proves the two facts every consumer needs about a *valid* diagram, one whose parameter is in
the range of the classification: it is connected, and its vector of *marks* is a null vector of the
Cartan matrix, positive at every node and normalized to `1` at a distinguished one. The marks span
the radical of the symmetrized form; only the null-vector half of that statement is proved here.

`TauCeti.DynkinType` has no affine constructors, and Mathlib's `CartanMatrix` family names no
affine type either, with one exception: the generalized `CartanMatrix.E n` continues the `E`
diagram past the finite range, and `CartanMatrix.E 9` is the affine `E₈` matrix under a different
numbering, and it is what the affine `E₈` matrix below is defined to be
(`TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.cartanMatrix_E8_eq_submatrix_cartanMatrix_E`). Tau Ceti also
already carries affine matrices as *obstructions* inside the finite-type classification:
`TauCeti.doubleForkCartanMatrix n` is the affine `Dₘ` matrix for `m = n + 5`, and
`TauCeti.starCartanMatrix` at `![2, 2, 2]`, `![1, 3, 3]` and `![1, 2, 5]` is the affine `E₆`, `E₇`
and `E₈` matrix. Those live on the sum and sigma
index types that make the classification argument uniform rather than on `Fin`, and their marks are
rational and unnormalized -- `TauCeti.starMark ![2, 2, 2]` is `9` times the marks below -- so
identifying them with the diagrams of this file is a relabelling problem of its own, of a piece
with the Bourbaki relabelling that the roadmap asks for and that is not proved here either. This
file is the affine complement, and it is deliberately *graph* first, because its consumers --
zigzag and preprojective algebras, and the McKay correspondence -- start from the diagram rather
than from a root system.

## Conventions

Except for `A₁`, an affine simply-laced diagram is a simple graph, and its generalized Cartan
matrix is `2I - A` for the adjacency matrix `A`. The exception is genuine: `A₁` has the
multiplicity-two matrix `!![2, -2; -2, 2]`, which is not `2I - A` for any simple graph
(`TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.cartanMatrix_A_one_ne_two_smul_one_sub_adjMatrix`). It is carved out by
`TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.IsGraphical`, the predicate `t ≠ A 1`, which every statement reading an
entry of the Cartan matrix off the graph assumes; the underlying graph of `A₁` is still defined,
as the single edge obtained by forgetting the multiplicity, but it does not determine the matrix.
The statements that survive at `A₁` -- the diagonal, the symmetry, the diagram of the matrix and
the null vector -- carry no such hypothesis.

The node numberings are chosen so that every node other than `0` has a neighbour with a smaller
number, which reduces connectedness to a single induction. Explicitly:

* `Aₙ` is the cycle on `Fin (n + 1)`, Mathlib's `SimpleGraph.cycleGraph`;
* `Dₙ` is the path `0 - 1 - ⋯ - (n-2)` with a further leaf `n - 1` attached at node `1` and a
  further leaf `n` attached at node `n - 3`. For `n = 4` those two attachment nodes coincide and
  the diagram is the four-leaf star, as it should be;
* `E₆`, `E₇`, `E₈` are the trees `T₃,₃,₃`, `T₂,₄,₄`, `T₂,₃,₆` with the trivalent node numbered `0`
  and the arms numbered consecutively outwards.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.AffineDynkinType`: the enumeration `Aₙ`, `Dₙ`, `E₆`, `E₇`, `E₈`.
* `TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.nodes`, `.Valid`: node count, and the range on which the names of the
  classification are pairwise distinct.
* `TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.IsGraphical`: the diagrams other than `A₁`, those whose generalized
  Cartan matrix is read off a simple graph.
* `TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.graph`: the underlying simple graph.
* `TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.cartanMatrix`: the generalized Cartan matrix.
* `TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.marks`: the marks, and `.affineNode`, the node whose mark is `1`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.graph_connected`: every valid affine simply-laced diagram is
  connected.
* `TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.graph_A_adj`, `.graph_D_adj`, `.graph_E6_adj`, `.graph_E7_adj`,
  `.graph_E8_adj`: adjacency in each diagram, as a condition on node numbers.
* `TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.cartanMatrix_eq_graphCartanMatrix`: outside `A₁` the Cartan matrix is
  the matrix `2I - A` of the underlying graph, `SimpleGraph.graphCartanMatrix`.
* `TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.graph_eq_diagramGraph_cartanMatrix`: the graph is the diagram of the
  Cartan matrix in the sense of `TauCeti.diagramGraph`, at `A₁` too.
* `TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.cartanMatrix_E8_eq_submatrix_cartanMatrix_E`: affine `E₈` is Mathlib's
  `CartanMatrix.E 9`, relabelled, which is how it is defined.
* `TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.sum_marks_neighborFinset_eq_two_mul`: twice the mark of a node is the
  sum of the marks of its neighbours.
* `TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.cartanMatrix_mulVec_marks_eq_zero`: the marks are a null vector,
  `Cδ = 0`.
* `TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.marks_affineNode`: the mark at the affine node is `1`.
