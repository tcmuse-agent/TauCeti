# The minuscule weight orbit of type E6

This file enumerates the Weyl orbit of the first fundamental weight of the pinned simply connected
root datum `TauCeti.DynkinType.e6SimplyConnectedRootDatum`. The twenty-seven weights are expressed
in the fundamental-weight basis `Fin 6 → ℤ`. The first weight is `ϖ₁`, and the table is closed under
the six Bourbaki-numbered simple reflections through explicit permutations of `Fin 27`.

The reflection equation is the key interface for the future 27-dimensional minuscule module: a
simple root operator can move a coordinate basis vector only when the corresponding weight pairs
to `1` or `-1`. The table records that every such pairing lies in `{-1, 0, 1}`, identifies the table
with the full Weyl orbit, and proves that its weights span the complete character lattice. The last
property is what lets the represented weight torus of an admissible minuscule lattice be a closed
immersion, rather than seeing only the index-three root lattice of the adjoint representation.

The table is *not* stable under the pinned diagram symmetry `TauCeti.graphPermE6`, which exchanges
`ϖ₁` and `ϖ₆` and so carries the weights of `V(ϖ₁)` to those of `V(ϖ₆) = V(ϖ₁)ˣ`, their negatives.
The last two sections make that exchange explicit and repair it: `e6MinusculeGraphDualPerm` is the
involution of the index set implementing it, and `e6DoubledMinusculeWeight` is the fifty-four-weight
family of `V(ϖ₁) ⊕ V(ϖ₆)`, which is stable, is still injective, and still spans. A carrier inherits
a symmetry of its numbered data only when its weight family is equivariant, the hypothesis
`wt (π i) (τ k) = wt i k` of
`TauCeti.UniversalEnvelopingAlgebra.kostantToralNumberedSymmetryIso`, which the doubled family
meets and the minuscule family alone does not.

No representation or group scheme is constructed here. This is the pinned weight-diagram input
for the type-`E₆` full-weight Chevalley--Demazure carrier in Layer 9 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`, consumed by milestone L0 of the CFSG statement roadmap,
the doubled family being what its graph-twisted family `²E₆(q)` needs where `E₆(q)` does not.

## References

The node numbering and the choice of the minuscule weight `ϖ₁` follow Bourbaki, *Lie Groups and Lie
Algebras, Chapters 4--6*, Plate V. The minuscule-orbit description of the 27-dimensional
representation follows J. E. Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory*,
§13.4, and J. C. Jantzen, *Representations of Algebraic Groups*, II.2. That the diagram
automorphism exchanges the two twenty-seven dimensional representations, and the conventions for
`²E₆(q)` that makes this relevant to, are R. W. Carter, *Simple Groups of Lie Type*, §12.2.

/-- **The twenty-seven weights in the Weyl orbit of the type-`E₆` minuscule weight `ϖ₁`.**

Coordinates are pairings with the six Bourbaki-numbered simple coroots. The ordering begins at
`ϖ₁ = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)` and then lists weights reached successively by simple reflections; no
mathematical structure depends on the ordering. -/
