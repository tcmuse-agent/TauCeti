# Squared lengths of the pinned `G₂` roots

`TauCeti.DynkinType.g2SimplyConnectedRootDatum` tabulates its twelve roots in the
fundamental-weight basis and its twelve coroots in the simple-coroot basis, and
`TauCeti.DynkinType.g2Coeff` records their simple-root coordinates. None of those tables displays
how long a root is, which a consumer that has to distinguish long roots from short ones needs, and
which is what a characteristic-three special isogeny of type `G₂` does.

This file supplies the missing squared-length table, in the pinned index order

```text
α₁,  α₂,  α₁ + α₂,  2 α₁ + α₂,  3 α₁ + α₂,  3 α₁ + 2 α₂
```

on the positive roots, index `k + 6` being the negative of index `k`.

`TauCeti.DynkinType.g2Length` is normalised as `TauCeti.DynkinType.rootLength` normalises the
simple roots: `1` on the six short roots `± α₁, ± (α₁ + α₂), ± (2 α₁ + α₂)` and `3` on the six long
ones `± α₂, ± (3 α₁ + α₂), ± (3 α₁ + 2 α₂)`. That normalisation is not a stipulation:
`TauCeti.DynkinType.g2Length_mul_g2Coroot` derives the whole table from the two simple lengths by
expanding `β∨ = 2 β / (β, β)` on the simple coroots, and
`TauCeti.DynkinType.eq_g2Length_of_mul_g2Coroot` shows those equations determine it.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DynkinType.g2Length`: the squared lengths of the twelve roots.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DynkinType.g2Length_mul_g2Coroot` and
  `TauCeti.DynkinType.eq_g2Length_of_mul_g2Coroot`: the length table is the one forced by the two
  simple lengths.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.g2Length_castLE`: on the two simple roots it is
  `TauCeti.DynkinType.rootLength`.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.isLongSimpleRoot_iff_g2Length_eq_three` and
  `TauCeti.DynkinType.g2Length_castLE_eq_one_iff`: the long simple root is the one of length three
  and the short one the one of length one.
