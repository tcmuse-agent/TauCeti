# Computable Gauss-Jordan elimination

Mathlib says what it means for a matrix to be in (reduced) row echelon form
(`Matrix.IsRowEchelon`, `Matrix.IsReducedRowEchelon`, `Matrix.IsPivotedBy`) but has no algorithm
producing one. This file supplies the algorithm, as a genuine `def` on
`[DivisionRing F] [DecidableEq F]` data, together with its two correctness statements: the output
is in reduced row echelon form, and it spans the same subspace as the input.

The rows are carried as a `List (Fin n → F)` rather than as a matrix, because elimination changes
the number of rows it keeps: `TauCeti.rowReduce L` returns a list of pairs
`(pivot column, reduced row)`, one for each pivot, so the pivot data is part of the output rather
than something to be recovered from it afterwards.

The algorithm is Gauss-Jordan rather than plain Gaussian elimination: at each column a pivot row is
scaled to have a `1` there and is then subtracted from *every* other row, the rows already retained
included. So there is no back-substitution pass, and the invariant is maintained in one sweep over
the columns.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.rowReduce`: the reduced row echelon form of a list of rows, as a list of
  `(pivot column, row)` pairs.
* `TauCeti.rowReduceMatrix` and `TauCeti.rowReducePivot`: that output read as a matrix together
  with its pivot map.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isReducedRowEchelon_rowReduceMatrix`: **the output is in reduced row echelon form**, and
  `TauCeti.isPivotedBy_rowReduceMatrix` identifies its pivots as the recorded columns. Since
  `Matrix.IsPivotedBy.rank_eq` reads the rank off the pivots, this gives
  `TauCeti.rank_rowReduceMatrix`: the reduced matrix has full row rank.
* `TauCeti.span_rowReduce`: **elimination preserves the row space**; the reduced rows span exactly
  what the original rows span.
* `TauCeti.length_rowReduce_ofFn`: the two together say that **the sweep computes the rank**, the
  number of pivots it records in the rows of a matrix being `Matrix.rank` of that matrix.

## Implementation notes

The sweep, the state it threads, and the invariant it maintains are all private, and no definition
here exposes its body: the supported interface is `TauCeti.rowReduce` together with the results
above, `TauCeti.rowReduceMatrix_apply` and `TauCeti.rowReducePivot_apply` standing in for the two
wrappers' bodies. So nothing downstream is committed to how the sweep represents its intermediate
data.

That state is a pair: the pivot rows found so far, each tagged with its pivot column, and the rows
not yet used as a pivot. A row that is used as a pivot is not removed from the second component;
subtracting the scaled pivot from it turns it into the zero row, which is harmless and saves the
algorithm (and every proof about it) from having to delete a list element. When the sweep reaches
the last column every row of the second component vanishes identically, which is what
`TauCeti.span_rowReduce` uses to discard it.

Only the columns are indexed by `Fin n`; the rows are an arbitrary list. Restricting the columns is
deliberate: the sweep must visit them in increasing order, and `List.finRange n` is the enumeration
that comes with the proof `List.pairwise_lt_finRange` that it does. The auxiliary sweep takes the
column list as an argument and the results about it assume only that the list is strictly
increasing, so the choice is confined to `TauCeti.rowReduce` itself.

The algebraic assumptions reflect the different parts of the argument. The invariant
`IsRowReduceState` and the lemma that starts a sweep in it need only `[Zero F] [One F]`: the state
records a `1` in each pivot column and a `0` elsewhere, and reads nothing else of `F`.
Extending the invariant across a
pivoting step needs `[NonAssocRing F]`, to subtract a multiple of the pivot row; it never divides,
so it is stated for an arbitrary already-normalised row. The row space `rowSpan` of a state, with
the three lemmas characterising it as the span of the rows the state carries, needs only
`[Semiring F]`: those only take and reflect a span. The sweep itself needs `[DivisionRing F]`
and `[DecidableEq F]`, to scale a row by `(v j)⁻¹` and to test entries against zero, so every
result about what the sweep *does* to the invariant or to the row space is stated there. Only
`TauCeti.rank_rowReduceMatrix` and `TauCeti.length_rowReduce_ofFn` need `F` commutative,
`Matrix.rank` being defined over a commutative semiring.

The reduced form also determines a basis of the kernel: each free column supplies one basis
vector, with the reduced rows giving its coordinates in the pivot columns. This construction is
implemented in `TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.Echelon.KernelBasis`.
