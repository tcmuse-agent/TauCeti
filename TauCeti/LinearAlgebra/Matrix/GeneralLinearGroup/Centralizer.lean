# Centralizers of the regular elements of `GL₂`

A `2 × 2` matrix over a field is **regular** as soon as it is not scalar: it is then cyclic
(nonderogatory), and the matrices commuting with it are exactly the polynomials in it, the
two-dimensional algebra `F[M]`. That is `TauCeti.commute_fin_two_iff`, from
`TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.Commute`, and it is what organizes this file.

Two consequences organize the conjugacy classes of `GL₂(F)`. First, the commutant of a non-scalar
matrix is commutative, so the centralizer of a non-central element of `GL₂(F)` is an **abelian**
subgroup (`TauCeti.isMulCommutative_centralizer_of_notMem_range_scalar`). Second, when a regular
element generates a maximal commutative subalgebra of `Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F` — a split one,
`F × F`, or a quadratic field extension `E/F` — its centralizer is that subalgebra's unit group:

* the *split* case, an invertible diagonal matrix with distinct diagonal entries: its centralizer
  is the split torus `TauCeti.diagonalTorus F 2` of all invertible diagonal matrices
  (`TauCeti.centralizer_diagGL`), of order `(q - 1)²`, so its conjugacy class has `q (q + 1)`
  elements;
* the *non-split* case, an element of `TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus` — the unit group of a quadratic
  field extension `E/F` — that does not come from `F`: its centralizer is that whole group
  (`TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus.centralizer_gl2NonSplitTorusHom`), of order `q² - 1`, so its
  conjugacy class has `q (q - 1)` elements.

The split computation needs no commutant: a matrix commuting with a diagonal matrix of distinct
entries is diagonal (`TauCeti.isDiag_of_commute_diagonal`), and the torus is commutative. The same
is true of the non-semisimple case below, where two entry equations do the work. It is the
non-split case, and the abelianness of a general non-central centralizer, that consume
`TauCeti.commute_fin_two_iff`.

Over a finite field — more generally whenever `E/F` is separable — both elements are **regular
semisimple** and both centralizers are the **maximal torus** containing the element, split in the
first case and elliptic in the second. Those words are used only under that hypothesis: over an
imperfect field of characteristic two a purely inseparable quadratic extension `E/F` satisfies the
hypotheses of `TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus.centralizer_gl2NonSplitTorusHom`, and there multiplication
by an element of `E ∖ F` is not semisimple and `Eˣ` is not a torus; the general statement is proved
and read as a centralizer computation for a quadratic extension, with no semisimplicity claimed.
The counting results all assume `F` finite, where the torus language is unconditionally correct.

Both computations are stated for a normal form — a diagonal matrix, and an element of the non-split
torus in the basis `TauCeti.nonSplitTorusBasis` — rather than for an arbitrary regular semisimple
element. `TauCeti.exists_isConj_normalForm` of
`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/GeneralLinearGroup/NormalForm.lean` exhausts `GL₂(𝔽_q)` by four
named normal forms, of which these two are the regular semisimple ones — the central scalar
family is semisimple too, but not regular. That a *regular semisimple* element falls into one of
those two rather than into the scalar or the Jordan family, and that a centralizer transports
along a conjugation, are not proved here.

The third regular family is also here. A **non-semisimple** element is a Jordan block
`TauCeti.jordanGL a b = !![a, b; 0, a]` with `b ≠ 0`; it is again regular
(`TauCeti.notMem_range_scalar_jordanGL`), and its centralizer is
the scalar-unipotent subgroup `TauCeti.GL2ScalarUnipotent F` of all `!![x, y; 0, x]`
(`TauCeti.centralizer_jordanGL`), of order `q (q - 1)`, so its conjugacy class has `q² - 1`
elements. That subgroup is the product `Z U` of the centre with the unipotent radical of the Borel
subgroup, so it is `Gₘ × Gₐ` and not a torus — which is precisely what distinguishes this family
from the two semisimple ones.

The fourth family, the **central** one, is the non-regular case this file's title excludes: a
scalar matrix is central in `GL n R` for any index type and any commutative semiring, so its
centralizer is everything and its class is a single point. The centralizer half is proved at that
generality in `TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.Diagonal.Basic`
(`TauCeti.centralizer_scalar`); the class size, `TauCeti.ncard_carrier_mk_scalar`, is here with the
other three.

Together the four families give the class sizes `1`, `q (q + 1)`, `q (q - 1)` and `q² - 1`. These
are the sizes of the individual classes, not the numbers of classes in each family: the
non-semisimple family, for instance, has one class for each of the `q - 1` possible eigenvalues.
That every element of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` is conjugate to one of the four normal forms, and with it any
enumeration of the classes themselves, is not proved here.

The class sizes are read off the centralizer orders by orbit-stabilizer
(`ConjClasses.ncard_carrier_mk`), together with `TauCeti.natCard_GL_fin_two`, which gives
`|GL₂(𝔽_q)| = (q - 1)² q (q + 1)`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isMulCommutative_centralizer_of_notMem_range_scalar`: the centralizer of a non-central
  element of `GL (Fin 2) F` is abelian.
* `TauCeti.centralizer_diagGL`, `TauCeti.natCard_centralizer_diagGL`,
  `TauCeti.ncard_carrier_mk_diagGL`: the centralizer of an invertible diagonal matrix with
  distinct entries is the split torus, of order `(q - 1)²`, and its conjugacy class has `q (q + 1)`
  elements.
* `TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus.centralizer_gl2NonSplitTorusHom`,
  `TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus.natCard_centralizer_gl2NonSplitTorusHom`,
  `TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus.ncard_carrier_mk_gl2NonSplitTorusHom`: the centralizer of an element of
  the non-split torus not coming from `F` — an elliptic element, over a finite field — is that
  whole torus, of order `q² - 1`, and its conjugacy class has `q (q - 1)` elements.
* `TauCeti.centralizer_jordanGL`, `TauCeti.natCard_centralizer_jordanGL`,
  `TauCeti.ncard_carrier_mk_jordanGL`: the centralizer of a Jordan block `!![a, b; 0, a]` with
  `b ≠ 0` — a non-semisimple element — is the scalar-unipotent subgroup, of order `q (q - 1)`, and
  its conjugacy class has `q² - 1` elements.
* `TauCeti.ncard_carrier_mk_scalar`: the conjugacy class of a scalar matrix is a single point.

/-- **The centralizer of an invertible diagonal matrix with distinct entries.** Over a commutative
semiring in which every nonzero element cancels, such a matrix has, as its centralizer, exactly the
diagonal torus `TauCeti.diagonalTorus k 2` of all invertible diagonal matrices.

Both inclusions come from the diagonal API: a matrix commuting with a diagonal matrix of distinct
entries is diagonal (`TauCeti.isDiag_of_commute_diagonal`), and conversely the torus is
commutative, so it centralizes each of its own elements. Only the first of these needs anything of
`k`, and only that its two distinct diagonal entries be separated by cancellation, so neither
subtraction nor inverses are used; a field is needed just for the counting below.

Over a field — where `IsCancelMulZero` is automatic — this is **the centralizer of a split regular
semisimple element of `GL₂`**: a diagonal matrix with distinct entries is then regular semisimple,
`TauCeti.diagonalTorus k 2` is the split maximal torus, and the theorem says that the centralizer
of the element is the maximal torus containing it. -/

semisimple and `TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus F E hE` is the maximal torus containing it. Together with

semisimple normal forms of `GL₂`, split and elliptic; that every regular semisimple element is
conjugate to one of them, and that a centralizer transports along such a conjugation, are not
proved here. Separability is not needed below: for a purely inseparable `E/F` in characteristic
two the statement computes the centralizer of an element that is *not* semisimple, and `Eˣ` is then

/-- **The centralizer of a Jordan block with regular off-diagonal entry.** Over any commutative
ring, the centralizer of `TauCeti.jordanGL a b = !![a, b; 0, a]` with `b` left-regular — over a
field, any `b ≠ 0` — is the scalar-unipotent subgroup `TauCeti.GL2ScalarUnipotent R` of the matrices
`!![x, y; 0, x]`.

Like the split case this needs no commutant, and for the same reason: only the two entry equations
`b · g₁₀ = b · 0` and `b · g₁₁ = b · g₀₀` of `M g = g M` are used, and cancelling `b` from them is
what solves them — no division and no hypothesis on the other elements of `R`, so left-regularity of
`b` alone is enough, and a field is asked for only by the counting below. That the diagonal entry so
obtained is a unit is read off the determinant `g₀₀²`. The reverse inclusion is the commutativity of
`TauCeti.GL2ScalarUnipotent R`.

Over a field this is the centralizer of a **non-semisimple** element, and unlike the split and
elliptic cases it is **not** a torus: it is the product `Z U` of the centre with the unipotent
radical of the Borel subgroup, `Gₘ × Gₐ` rather than `Gₘ × Gₘ`, which is exactly the failure of `M`
to be semisimple. As with the two semisimple normal forms, that every non-semisimple element of

conjugation, are not proved here. -/
