# Diagonal elements of the general linear group, and the diagonal torus

A family of units indexed by a finite type `ι` is the diagonal of an invertible diagonal matrix,
and this assignment is a group homomorphism `TauCeti.diagGL : (ι → kˣ) →* GL ι k`. Its entries,
its trace, its determinant and its injectivity are recorded here, together with the fact that
invertibility of a diagonal matrix upgrades its diagonal entries to units.  The facts about
diagonal matrices that involve no general linear group live in
`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Diagonal.lean`; the one used below is that a matrix commuting with a
diagonal matrix has no entry away from the diagonal wherever that diagonal matrix separates two
coordinates.

The image of `diagGL` is gathered into a subgroup

`TauCeti.diagonalTorus k n = (TauCeti.diagGL : (Fin n → kˣ) →* GL (Fin n) k).range`,

the **diagonal torus** of `GL n k`, and what makes it a *maximal* torus is proved.

Three descriptions of the same subgroup are given.  It is the range of `diagGL`, so it is
isomorphic as a group to the coordinatewise units `Fin n → kˣ`
(`TauCeti.diagonalTorusEquiv`), whence its order `(q - 1)ⁿ` over a division ring with `q` elements
(`TauCeti.natCard_diagonalTorus`).  It is cut out inside `GL n k` by a condition on matrix entries:
an invertible matrix lies in it exactly when it is diagonal (`TauCeti.mem_diagonalTorus_iff`),
the point being that invertibility upgrades the diagonal entries of a diagonal matrix to units
(`TauCeti.isUnit_apply_of_isDiag`).  And it is its own centralizer
(`TauCeti.centralizer_diagonalTorus`), so it is a maximal abelian subgroup: no larger subgroup of
`GL n k` contains it and is commutative.

The embedding, the torus, the equivalence and the membership criterion ask only that `k` be a
semiring; commutativity of `k` enters with the self-centralization and with the determinant,
cancellation by nonzero elements with the self-centralization as well, and the order asks for a
division ring, where the nonzero elements are exactly the units.

Self-centralization is proved under two hypotheses, neither of them idle.  Cancellation is a
sufficient hypothesis rather than a necessary one: an off-diagonal entry `g i j` of a centralizing
matrix satisfies `g i j * t i = g i j * t j` for diagonal entries `t i ≠ t j`, and
`IsCancelMulZero k` is what forces that entry to vanish — no subtraction is involved, so a
commutative semiring suffices, and the two diagonal entries need not differ by a unit
(`TauCeti.apply_eq_zero_of_commute_diagonal`).  Over a ring, `IsCancelMulZero` is exactly
`NoZeroDivisors`.  The second
hypothesis, that the unit group has two distinct elements, is there because a diagonal matrix can
only separate the coordinate lines it distinguishes; two units already suffice, because only one
pair of coordinates is separated at a time.  That one cannot simply be dropped, and what happens
without it is recorded here: over a ring with only one unit, such as `𝔽₂`, the torus is trivial
(`TauCeti.diagonalTorus_eq_bot`) while its centralizer is the whole of `GL n k`
(`TauCeti.centralizer_diagonalTorus_eq_top`).  These two subgroups differ, so self-centralization
genuinely fails, exactly when `GL n k` is itself nontrivial — over `𝔽₂` that is the case for
`n ≥ 2`, while for `n ≤ 1` the whole group is trivial and the conclusion survives for want of
anything to contradict it.

The smallest diagonal matrices, the scalar ones, are treated here as well: a scalar matrix is
central in `GL ι k` (`TauCeti.scalar_mem_center`), so its centralizer is the whole group
(`TauCeti.centralizer_scalar`). Nothing there is special to `Fin n` or to a field, so both are
stated for an arbitrary finite index type over a commutative semiring. The size of the resulting
conjugacy class — the easy end of the class table of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` — is
`TauCeti.ncard_carrier_mk_scalar`, in
`TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.Centralizer` alongside the other class sizes, so
that conjugacy theory stays out of this module's imports.

The action of the torus on the coordinate lines of the standard representation is in
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.ClassicalGroups.Torus`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.diagGL` embeds a family of units as an invertible diagonal matrix.
* `TauCeti.diagonalTorus`: the subgroup of invertible diagonal matrices in `GL n k`.
* `TauCeti.diagonalTorusEquiv`: the identification `(Fin n → kˣ) ≃* diagonalTorus k n`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.isUnit_apply_of_isDiag`: the diagonal entries of an invertible diagonal matrix are
  units.
* `TauCeti.exists_det_eq_one_mul_map_eq_map_mul_diagGL`: a matrix intertwining another matrix with
  a diagonal matrix can be normalized to have determinant one while preserving the equation.
* `TauCeti.mem_diagonalTorus_iff`: membership in the torus is diagonality of the matrix.
* `TauCeti.mul_diagGL_of_coe_eq_permMatrix`: a permutation matrix moves past a diagonal by
  relabelling its entries.
* `TauCeti.natCard_diagonalTorus`: the torus has `(q - 1)ⁿ` elements over a division ring with `q`
  elements.
* `TauCeti.centralizer_diagonalTorus`: the diagonal torus is its own centralizer.
* `TauCeti.centralizer_diagonalTorus_eq_top`: over a ring with a single unit the centralizer is
  instead the whole group.
* `TauCeti.scalar_mem_center` and `TauCeti.centralizer_scalar`: a scalar matrix is central, so its
  centralizer is the whole group.
* `TauCeti.diagGL_const` and `TauCeti.notMem_range_scalar_diagGL`: the diagonal embedding sends a
  constant family to the corresponding scalar element, and in size two it is scalar *only* there.
