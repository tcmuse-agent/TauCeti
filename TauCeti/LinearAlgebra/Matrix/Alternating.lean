# Matrices equal to the negative of their transpose

A matrix satisfying `Mᵀ = -M` is determined by its entries above the diagonal, once its diagonal
is known to vanish: the entries below are the negatives of their mirror images. The diagonal does
vanish as soon as the value ring has no element that is its own negative apart from zero, which
covers every ring of odd characteristic.

## Main results

* `Matrix.transpose_single_sub_single`: transposing the difference of two opposite singleton
  matrices with the same coefficient negates it.
* `Matrix.transpose_map_of_transpose_eq_neg`: the condition passes to the image of the matrix
  under an additive morphism of the entry types.
* `Matrix.diag_eq_zero_of_transpose_eq_neg`: the diagonal vanishes when doubling is injective at
  zero, with `Matrix.diag_eq_zero_of_transpose_eq_neg_of_charP` reading that off an odd
  characteristic.
* `Matrix.ext_of_lt_of_transpose_eq_neg`: two such matrices with vanishing diagonals agree as soon
  as they agree above the diagonal.
