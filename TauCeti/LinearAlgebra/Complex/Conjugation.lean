# The real points of a conjugate-linear involution

A **conjugation** of a complex vector space `V` is a conjugate-linear map `K : V → V` with
`K ∘ K = id`, that is, a `starRingEnd ℂ`-semilinear self-map that is involutive.  Its **real
points** are the vectors it fixes.  They form a real subspace `TauCeti.realPoints K`, and the main
theorem of this file is that `V` is the complexification of that subspace: the canonical map

`ℂ ⊗[ℝ] realPoints K → V`, `c ⊗ₜ w ↦ c • w`

is a `ℂ`-linear isomorphism.  Conversely a complexification `ℂ ⊗[ℝ] W` carries the conjugation
`c ⊗ₜ w ↦ conj c ⊗ₜ w` (`TauCeti.tmulConj`), whose real points are the image of `W`.  So each of
the two constructions produces the other: a conjugation on `V` presents `V` as a complexification,
and a complexification carries a conjugation.  That is what makes conjugations the tool for
realizing an object over `ℝ`.

The two constructions are not set up here as mutually inverse, and nothing here transports
`TauCeti.tmulConj` along an isomorphism `ℂ ⊗[ℝ] W ≃ₗ[ℂ] V`: a presentation of `V` as a
complexification carries a noncanonical choice of real carrier and isomorphism, which a conjugation
does not.  The equivariant form of that transport is
`Representation.IsRealForm.exists_isRealStructure`, downstream in
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.RealForm`.

Everything is stated for an arbitrary `V`; no finite-dimensionality is used anywhere.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.realPoints`: the real points of a conjugate-linear map, as a `Submodule ℝ V`.
* `TauCeti.conjRealPart` and `TauCeti.conjImaginaryPart`: the two real points a vector decomposes
  into; `TauCeti.conjRealPart_def` and `TauCeti.conjImaginaryPart_def` are their defining formulas.
* `TauCeti.realPointsLift`: the canonical `ℂ`-linear map `ℂ ⊗[ℝ] realPoints K →ₗ[ℂ] V`.
* `TauCeti.realPointsEquiv`: that map as a `ℂ`-linear isomorphism, for involutive `K`.
* `TauCeti.tmulConj`: the conjugation `c ⊗ₜ w ↦ conj c ⊗ₜ w` of a complexification `ℂ ⊗[ℝ] W`.
* `TauCeti.realPart`: the real-linear retraction from a complexification to its real module.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.conjRealPart_add_I_smul_conjImaginaryPart`: the decomposition
  `v = conjRealPart K v + I • conjImaginaryPart K v`, which makes `TauCeti.realPointsLift`
  surjective.
* `TauCeti.realPointsLift_injective`, `TauCeti.realPointsLift_surjective` and
  `TauCeti.realPointsEquiv`: **a complex vector space is the complexification of the real points of
  any conjugation on it.**
* `TauCeti.span_realPoints_eq_top`: the real points of an involutive conjugation span `V` over
  `ℂ`, so an identity between `ℂ`-linear or `ℂ`-bilinear maps may be checked on real vectors
  alone.
* `TauCeti.finrank_realPoints`: the real points have the `ℝ`-dimension that `V` has over `ℂ`.
* `TauCeti.exists_one_tmul_add_I_tmul`: every element of `ℂ ⊗[ℝ] W` is `1 ⊗ₜ w₁ + I ⊗ₜ w₂`; this
  is what makes the lift injective.
* `TauCeti.tmulConj_involutive`, `TauCeti.tmulConj_tmul` and `TauCeti.tmulConj_eq_self_iff`: the
  conjugation of a complexification and its real points.
* `TauCeti.tmulConj_baseChange`: that conjugation commutes with every base-changed map, which is
  what makes it equivariant for a base-changed action.

## Implementation notes

A conjugation is carried here as the two unbundled hypotheses `K : V →ₛₗ[starRingEnd ℂ] V` and
`Function.Involutive K`, rather than as a bundled structure.  `TauCeti.Hodge.Conjugation` already
bundles exactly this data, but it lives downstream in `TauCeti/Geometry/Hodge/`, so bundling here
would either duplicate it or invert the dependency between `TauCeti.LinearAlgebra` and
`TauCeti.Geometry`; a `TauCeti.Hodge.Conjugation` supplies the hypotheses below from its two
fields.  For the same reason `TauCeti.realPoints` asks only for the semilinear map: the subspace
makes sense without involutivity, and only the complexification theorem needs it.

Mathlib's `realPart`/`imaginaryPart` decomposition of a star module over `ℂ` is the same
mathematics, but it reads the conjugation off the `Star` *instance* on `V`: `selfAdjoint.submodule`
and `realPart` both ask for `[StarAddMonoid V] [StarModule ℂ V]`, and `StarAddMonoid` already
carries involutivity.  Here the conjugation is instead a term `K` that `TauCeti.realPoints` and
`TauCeti.conjRealPart` are indexed by, because one `V` carries many conjugations and
`TauCeti.realPoints` is wanted before `K` is known to be involutive -- `TauCeti.realPointsLift` is
injective for every conjugate-linear `K`.  So the instance-borne spelling is not available here,
and a `TauCeti.Hodge.Conjugation`, or a `Representation.IsRealStructure`, hands its conjugation
over as a field rather than as an instance.

No definition here exposes its body: `TauCeti.mem_realPoints`, `TauCeti.conjRealPart_def`,
`TauCeti.conjImaginaryPart_def`, `TauCeti.realPointsLift_tmul`, `TauCeti.realPointsEquiv_tmul`,
`TauCeti.realPointsEquiv_symm_apply` and `TauCeti.tmulConj_tmul` are the characterizations a
consumer works from.

The real scalar structure on `V` is Mathlib's `Module.complexToReal`, the one `Module ℂ V` induces,
so `r • v` and `(r : ℂ) • v` are definitionally equal and no scalar tower hypothesis is carried.
