# The Hilbert symbol of two units of a Henselian local ring

Let `R` be a Henselian local ring with finite residue field in which `2` is a unit, and let `K` be
a field with an `R`-algebra structure. The Hilbert symbol over `K` of the images of two units of
`R` is `1`: the norm equation `x² - u y² = u'` is already solvable in `R` by Hensel's lemma.

For the ring of integers of a nonarchimedean local field of odd residue characteristic, this is
the statement that the Hilbert symbol is trivial on pairs of units. It is the good-place
computation that makes the Hilbert symbols of two elements of a number field trivial at almost
every finite place.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.hilbertSymbol_units_map_eq_one`: `(u, u')_K = 1` for units `u` and `u'` of `R`.
