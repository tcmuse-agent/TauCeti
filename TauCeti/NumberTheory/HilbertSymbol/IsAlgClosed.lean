# The Hilbert symbol over algebraically closed fields

This file computes the norm-equation Hilbert symbol `TauCeti.hilbertSymbol` over algebraically
closed fields. Every element is a square, so the symbol is always `1`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.hilbertSymbol_eq_one_of_isAlgClosed`: the symbol is trivial over an algebraically closed
  field.
