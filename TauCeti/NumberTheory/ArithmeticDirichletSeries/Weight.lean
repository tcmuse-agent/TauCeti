# Completely multiplicative ideal weights

The completely multiplicative specializations of `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction`: the two
carriers on which every Euler product, Hecke character and character-family argument of this
development is stated.

A `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight K` is a monoid-with-zero homomorphism
`Ideal (𝓞 K) →*₀ ℂ` killing only finitely many height-one primes, and
`TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight K` is the subtype of those whose values have modulus `1` away from
that finite bad set. Using Mathlib's `→*₀` vocabulary is what pins the zero-ideal law
`χ ⊥ = 0`; the finiteness condition is what bounds the bad local factors of the Euler product.

Both carriers are *degree one*: the value at `𝔭 ^ n` is forced to be `χ 𝔭 ^ n`. They are
therefore deliberately too narrow for the ideal Möbius function or for coefficient systems
whose prime-power values are independent local data; those get separate carriers.

The organising notion is `Ideal.IsPrimeTo`, an ideal of a Dedekind domain being nonzero and
divisible by no prime of a given set; it is stated for a general Dedekind domain because
nothing in it is specific to a number field. The good ideals of a weight are the ideals
prime to its bad primes, and `Ideal.IsPrimeTo.induction_on` factors such an ideal into
good primes; this is the engine behind both
`TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.apply_ne_zero_iff_isGood` and
`TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.norm_eq_one`.

## Main declarations

* `Ideal.IsPrimeTo`: an ideal is nonzero and no prime of `S` divides it, with its
  multiplicativity (`Ideal.isPrimeTo_mul_iff`) and its induction principle
  (`Ideal.IsPrimeTo.induction_on`);
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight`: the general completely multiplicative carrier, its
  `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.badPrimes` and its good ideals
  (`TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.IsGood`);
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.apply_ne_zero_iff_isGood`: a weight is nonzero exactly on
  the good ideals;
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.ext_heightOneSpectrum`: a weight is determined by its
  values at the height-one primes;
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.ofBadPrimes`, the pointwise `CommMonoid` structure (whose
  unit is the trivial weight), `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.restrict`,
  `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.conj` and
  `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.normTwist`: the constructors and operations;
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.IsNormTwistOnGood` and
  `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.IsTrivialOnGood`: the weights agreeing with a purely
  imaginary norm twist, respectively with the trivial weight, on their good ideals, with the
  structure theorem `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.IsNormTwistOnGood.eq_normTwist`, its
  converse `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.isNormTwistOnGood_normTwist_ofBadPrimes`, and the
  behaviour of the parameter under conjugation, the pointwise product and a further twist;
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.toIdealArithmeticFunction`: passage to the general
  carrier, inverted by `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.zeroExtend`;
* `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight`: the unitary subtype, with
  `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.norm_eq_one` on all good ideals,
  `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.norm_normTwist` for the modulus of an arbitrary norm twist,
  `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.ofPowEqOne` for finite-order weights, and the operations
  `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.conj`, `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.restrict` and
  `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.normTwist` (the last for the imaginary norm twists only), and
  `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.toIdealArithmeticFunction` for its passage to the general carrier;
* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.map` and `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.map`, with their
  equivalences `mapEquiv`: functoriality under an isomorphism `K ≃+* L` of the ambient fields,
  together with the identity and composition laws, the preservation of the pointwise product
  (`map_one` and `map_mul` on both carriers), the naturality of restriction, conjugation and norm
  twists, and the compatibilities
  `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.badPrimes_map` and
  `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.toIdealArithmeticFunction_map`.

## Rejection tests

The two worked negative examples of this layer are proved here.
`TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.coe_ne_const_one` says the everywhere-one function on *all*
integral ideals underlies no weight, because `→*₀` forces the value `0` at `⊥` — the
everywhere-one function on the *nonzero* ideals is the trivial weight instead
(`TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.toIdealArithmeticFunction_one`).
`TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.norm_normTwist_apply_ne_one` says that a norm twist with
`Re z ≠ 0` changes the modulus at every good ideal of absolute norm greater than one, so such
twists live only in the general carrier.

### The general carrier of completely multiplicative ideal weights
-/

/-- A **multiplicative ideal weight** on a number field `K`: a completely multiplicative
complex-valued function on *all* integral ideals of `𝓞 K`, packaged as a monoid-with-zero
homomorphism `Ideal (𝓞 K) →*₀ ℂ`, which kills only finitely many height-one primes.

Being a `→*₀` forces the value `0` at the zero ideal `⊥` and the value `1` at `⊤`; the
finiteness condition is what makes the associated Euler product have finitely many bad local
factors. This carrier is *degree one*: its value at a prime power `𝔭 ^ n` is forced to be
`χ 𝔭 ^ n`, so it excludes the ideal Möbius function and any coefficient system whose
prime-power values are independent local data. -/

### Weights that are norm twists on their good locus
-/

/-- A weight **is a norm twist on its good ideals**, with parameter `u`, when
`χ I = N(I) ^ (u * I)` at every ideal `I` prime to its bad primes. Away from the bad primes such
a weight is the purely imaginary norm twist `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.normTwist` of the
trivial weight, and it is the whole of that twist once the bad primes are taken into account
(`TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.IsNormTwistOnGood.eq_normTwist`).

These weights give degenerate examples in families of ideal weights: their `L`-series is a
Dedekind zeta function with finitely many Euler factors deleted, read after an imaginary
translation, so it has a pole and no cancellation in its ideal partial sums
(`TauCeti.not_hasCancellation_of_isNormTwistOnGood`). -/
