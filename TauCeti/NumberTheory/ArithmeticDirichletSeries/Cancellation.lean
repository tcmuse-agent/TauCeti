# Cancellation in ideal partial sums and the continued L-function of a weight

For a unitary ideal weight `χ` of a number field `K` of degree `d = [K : ℚ]`, the partial sums
`∑_{N(I) ≤ x} χ(I)` over the nonzero integral ideals are trivially `O(x)`, by the linear ideal
count. For nontrivial finite-order ray class characters, equidistribution among ray classes gives
the stronger bound `O(x ^ (1 - 1 / d))`. This file names that bound as a hypothesis and extracts
its analytic consequence.

* `TauCeti.HasCancellation χ` is the uniform bound
  `‖∑_{N(I) ≤ x} χ(I)‖ ≤ C * x ^ (1 - 1 / d)` for every real cutoff `x ≥ 1`, with the inclusive
  summatory function `TauCeti.idealSummatory`.
  Equivalently (`TauCeti.hasCancellation_iff_isBigO`), the partial sums are
  `O(x ^ (1 - 1 / d))` as `x → ∞`.
* `TauCeti.continuedLFunctionOfWeight χ` is the partial-summation integral
  `s * ∫_{1}^{∞} (∑_{N(I) ≤ t} χ(I)) t ^ (-(s + 1)) dt`.

It agrees with the norm-regrouped L-series of `χ` on `Re s > 1` for *every* unitary weight
(`TauCeti.continuedLFunctionOfWeight_eq_LSeries`), and under `HasCancellation χ` it is holomorphic
on `Re s > 1 - 1 / d` (`TauCeti.differentiableOn_continuedLFunctionOfWeight`); so it is an analytic
continuation of the L-series of `χ` across the line `Re s = 1`.

Both are stable under deleting finitely many Euler factors, the operation a character family
needs at the bad primes of its modulus. A one-prime recurrence relates the partial sums after
inserting a forbidden prime to two partial sums before the insertion
(`TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.idealSummatory_restrict_insert`). Iterating this recurrence
shows that cancellation passes to the restriction (`TauCeti.HasCancellation.restrict`); on
`Re s > 1` the two continued
`L`-functions differ by the entire factor `∏ 𝔭 ∈ S, (1 - χ(𝔭) N(𝔭) ^ (-s))`
(`TauCeti.continuedLFunctionOfWeight_restrict_of_one_lt_re`), and under cancellation that identity
propagates to the whole half-plane `Re s > 1 - 1 / d`
(`TauCeti.continuedLFunctionOfWeight_restrict`).

In number-field degree greater than one, cancellation is also invariant under purely imaginary
norm twists (`TauCeti.hasCancellation_normTwist_iff`). Abel summation supplies this because the
cancellation exponent `1 - 1 / [K : ℚ]` is then positive. The degree-one case is deliberately not
claimed: the defining bound has exponent zero, while the absolute bound for the Abel integral is
logarithmic.

The continued `L`-function itself follows these operations. Conjugating the weight reflects it
in the real axis, `L(conj χ, conj s) = conj (L(χ, s))`, at every `s`
(`TauCeti.continuedLFunctionOfWeight_conj`). An imaginary norm twist by `N(I) ^ (-z)` translates
it by `z`: on `Re s > 1` for every weight
(`TauCeti.continuedLFunctionOfWeight_normTwist_of_one_lt_re`), and on the whole half-plane
`Re s > 1 - 1 / d` when both the weight and its twist have cancellation
(`TauCeti.continuedLFunctionOfWeight_normTwist`).

Cancellation is a hypothesis about the partial sums themselves. It cannot be replaced by
finiteness of the image of `χ` or of a quotient through which it factors: the values of a weight
factoring through a finite quotient of the free group on the prime ideals can be prescribed
arbitrarily prime by prime.

Nor is it automatic, and `TauCeti.not_hasCancellation_of_isNormTwistOnGood` says which weights it
excludes: those agreeing with a norm twist `I ↦ N(I) ^ (u * I)` on the ideals prime to their bad
primes. The `L`-series of such a weight is the Dedekind zeta function with finitely many Euler
factors deleted, read at `s - u * I`, so it has a pole at `s = 1 + u * I`, where cancellation
would instead make `continuedLFunctionOfWeight χ` holomorphic. The trivial weight
(`TauCeti.not_hasCancellation_one`) and its purely imaginary norm twists
(`TauCeti.not_hasCancellation_normTwist_one`) are the cases a character-family argument meets:
it must not assume cancellation for the degenerate members of its family.

### Deleting finitely many Euler factors
-/

/-- **Cancellation survives the deletion of finitely many Euler factors.** If the ideal partial
sums of a unitary weight `χ` are `O(x ^ (1 - 1 / [K : ℚ]))`, so are those of its restriction away
from a finite set of primes: each prime removed splits the partial sum into two partial sums of
the same order, at the cutoffs `x` and `x / N(𝔭)`.

Character-family arguments use this to pass between a weight and the one whose Euler factors at a
finite set of bad primes have been deleted. -/

/-- **Imaginary norm twists translate the continued L-function, across the line `Re s = 1`.**
If both a unitary weight and its twist by `N(I) ^ (-z)`, with `Re z = 0`, have cancellation,
then the continued L-function of the twist at `s` is the continued L-function of the weight at
`s + z`, throughout the half-plane `Re s > 1 - 1 / [K : ℚ]`.

In degree `[K : ℚ] > 1` the second cancellation hypothesis follows from the first, by
`TauCeti.HasCancellation.normTwist`. -/

### The rejection test: weights that are norm twists on their good ideals
-/

/-- **A weight that is a norm twist on its good ideals has no cancellation.** Its norm
coefficients are those of the indicator of the ideals prime to its bad primes, twisted by
`n ^ (u * I)`, so its `L`-series is the Dedekind zeta function with finitely many Euler factors
deleted, read at `s - u * I`. That series has a pole at `s = 1 + u * I`, a point at which
cancellation would make `TauCeti.continuedLFunctionOfWeight` holomorphic.

This is a rejection test for character-family arguments: these weights are degenerate examples
for which cancellation may not be assumed. -/
