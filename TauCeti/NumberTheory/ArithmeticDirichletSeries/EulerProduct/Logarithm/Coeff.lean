# Formal logarithmic-derivative coefficients of an ideal Euler product

An `EulerProductData K` has at every height-one prime `P` a canonical local power series

`F_P(X) = ∑ e, D(P ^ e) X ^ e`.

Its formal logarithm `log F_P` packages the general prime-power logarithmic expansion, including
coefficient systems whose values at higher prime powers are independent. The series

`X * F_P'(X) / F_P(X)`

then packages the local coefficients of the negative analytic logarithmic derivative: after
substituting `X = N(P) ^ (-s)`, its coefficient in degree `e` is multiplied by `log N(P)`.

The identity `(X F_P'/F_P) F_P = X F_P'` gives a finite recurrence for every coefficient. In
degrees one and two the coefficients are respectively
`D(P)` and `2 D(P ^ 2) - D(P) ^ 2`. For completely multiplicative degree-one data this reduces to
the familiar geometric family `χ(P) ^ e`, so the general construction agrees with the existing
prime-power logarithmic derivative rather than defining a parallel specialization.

These are formal identities: evaluating the logarithm series and differentiating it termwise are
separate analytic questions requiring convergence hypotheses.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.EulerProductData.localLogSeries`: the formal logarithm of a local Euler factor.
* `TauCeti.EulerProductData.localLogDerivSeries`: the series `X F_P'/F_P`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.EulerProductData.sum_antidiagonal_coeff_localLogDerivSeries_eq`: the coefficient
  recurrence determining the local logarithmic derivative.
* `TauCeti.EulerProductData.coeff_localLogDerivSeries_ofMultiplicativeIdealWeight`: the
  specialization to completely multiplicative weights.
