# Factoring a Dirichlet character through a divisor

Facts about when a Dirichlet character `χ` mod `N` factors through a divisor of `N`, stated for
characters valued in any `CommMonoidWithZero`, which is the generality of
`DirichletCharacter.factorsThrough_iff_ker_unitsMap` and of the conductor.

If `χ` does not factor through `d ∣ N`, then knowing a unit's reduction modulo `d` does not
determine its character value: every unit has a partner in the same fibre of `ZMod.unitsMap` on
which `χ` takes a different value. This is the form the level-lowering argument for the
conductor theorem consumes.

If the lift of `χ` to a multiple level factors through `d`, then `χ` itself factors through
`gcd (N, d)`: `changeLevel` preserves the conductor, which then divides both. This is how a
factorisation found at an auxiliary level is brought back to the level of `χ`; the arithmetic
case the descent uses is `d = L N / p` with `p ∣ N` coprime to `L`, where the gcd is `N / p`.

## Main results

* `DirichletCharacter.exists_alt_unit_in_coset_with_char_separation`: character separation within
  a fibre of the reduction map.
* `DirichletCharacter.factorsThrough_gcd_of_changeLevel_factorsThrough`: a factorisation of the
  lift to a multiple level through `d` descends to a factorisation of `χ` through `gcd (N, d)`,
  and `DirichletCharacter.factorsThrough_div_of_changeLevel_factorsThrough`: its arithmetic
  specialisation, from `L N / p` to `N / p`.
* `DirichletCharacter.exists_eq_comp_unitsMap_of_factorsThrough`: a factorisation of
  `MulChar.ofUnitHom χ` through `d`, read back on unit homomorphisms as `χ = χ₀ ∘ unitsMap`.
* `DirichletCharacter.conductor_eq_prime_pow_of_emod_eq_of_apply_ne_apply`: a primitivity
  criterion at a prime-power level, obtained by comparing values on congruent units, and its
  specialisations `DirichletCharacter.conductor_eq_four_of_apply_one_ne_apply_three` and
  `DirichletCharacter.conductor_eq_eight_of_apply_one_ne_apply_five`.

## Provenance

Adapted from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project (Chris Birkbeck,
`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0) at commit `2baa76f74`, file
`projects/LeanModularForms/LeanModularForms/Eigenforms/ConductorTheorem.lean`, declaration
`exists_alt_unit_in_coset_with_char_separation` (:656). The source reaches it through an
intermediate shift form (`exists_kernel_unit_with_char_shift`, :646) and a separate
non-factorisation witness (`exists_unit_of_not_factorsThrough`, :542); each is a one-line
consequence of the other, so only this form is ported and the extraction is done inline.

`factorsThrough_div_of_changeLevel_factorsThrough` is extracted from the same project at commit
`eb9621e7bcb0ce220ad53983ec45d987cb5b9002`, file
`projects/LeanModularForms/LeanModularForms/StrongMultiplicityOne/InductiveStep.lean`: the
conductor step inside the proof of `miyake_4_6_8_factor_dichotomy`, which the source carries as
the private lemmas `conductor_dvd_of_factorsThrough`, `factorsThrough_of_conductor_dvd` and
`conductor_changeLevel` specialised to `L N / p`. Here those three are Mathlib's
`conductor_dvd_of_mem_conductorSet`, `mem_conductorSet_iff_conductor_dvd` and
`conductor_changeLevel`, so what is ported is the arithmetic of the descent — the conductor
divides `gcd (N, L N / p) = N / p` — stated once for characters valued in any
`CommMonoidWithZero`.
