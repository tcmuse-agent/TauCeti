# A ramified prime of a quadratic field is totally ramified

Let `K` be a number field of degree `2` over `ℚ` and let `p` be a rational prime that ramifies
in `K`. This file proves the classical description of that ramification: there is exactly one
prime `𝔭` of `𝓞 K` above `p`, it has ramification index `2` and inertia degree `1`, and

`p 𝓞 K = 𝔭 ^ 2`.

The argument is the fundamental identity `∑_{𝔭 ∣ p} e(𝔭) f(𝔭) = [K : ℚ]`
(`Ideal.sum_ramification_inertia_eq_finrank`) with the right-hand side equal to `2`: every
summand is at least `1`, so a single summand with `e ≥ 2` exhausts the sum, forcing `e = 2`,
`f = 1` and no further primes above `p`. Turning the resulting `e = 2` into the ideal identity
`p 𝓞 K = 𝔭 ^ 2` is the Dedekind factorization `Ideal.map_algebraMap_eq_finsetProd_pow`, whose
product runs over the single prime `𝔭`.

This file covers every ramified prime of a quadratic field. The splitting law of
`TauCeti.NumberTheory.NumberField.Quadratic.Splitting` covers the odd primes `p ∤ d` not dividing
the radicand; the unramified prime `2` (that is, `d ≡ 1 mod 4`, where `2` is split or inert) is
described by neither file and remains open. It is the ramified case that genus theory needs: the
`2`-rank formula for `ℚ(√d)` rests on comparing the ramification of `p` in `ℚ(√d)` with its
ramification in the genus field, and `e(𝔭 ∣ p) = 2` is what makes the genus field unramified over
`ℚ(√d)` at `p`.

## Main results

All of the following assume `Module.finrank ℚ K = 2`. They live in the namespace `NumberField`,
except for the two `TauCeti.NumberField` results whose names are written out in full:

* `primesOver_eq_singleton_of_mem_ramifiedPrimes` and
  `ncard_primesOver_eq_one_of_mem_ramifiedPrimes`: a ramified prime has a unique prime above it.
* `ramificationIdx_eq_two_of_mem_ramifiedPrimes` and `inertiaDeg_eq_one_of_mem_ramifiedPrimes`:
  that prime has `e = 2` and `f = 1`.
* `absNorm_eq_of_mem_ramifiedPrimes`: its absolute norm is `p`.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.eq_of_absNorm_eq_of_mem_ramifiedPrimes`: every ideal of absolute norm `p`
  is that unique prime.
* `map_span_eq_sq_of_mem_ramifiedPrimes`: `p 𝓞 K = 𝔭 ^ 2`.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.eq_map_span_of_absNorm_eq_sq_of_mem_ramifiedPrimes`: every ideal of
  absolute norm `p ^ 2` is the ideal `p 𝓞 K`; hence
  `TauCeti.NumberField.isPrincipal_of_absNorm_eq_sq_of_mem_ramifiedPrimes`: it is principal.
* `map_eq_self_of_mem_ramifiedPrimes`: any ring automorphism of `𝓞 K` fixes `𝔭`.
* `mem_ramifiedPrimes_iff_ramificationIdx_eq_two`: conversely, `e = 2` characterises the ramified
  primes among the rational primes.
