# The signature map of a number field is surjective

`NumberField.fieldUnitSignature` records the sign of an element of `Kˣ` under each real
embedding of a number field `K`, as a point of the sign group
`{w : InfinitePlace K // w.IsReal} → ℝˣ ⧸ Units.posSubgroup ℝ`. This file proves that every sign
pattern is realized: the signature map is surjective, its kernel being the totally positive
elements, so `Kˣ ⧸ totallyPositiveUnits` *is* the sign group and the totally positive elements have
index exactly `2 ^ r₁` in `Kˣ`, with `r₁` the number of real places.

The input is weak approximation at the real places,
`NumberField.exists_ne_zero_forall_isReal_pos`. The analogous *unit* signature
`NumberField.unitSignature` need not be surjective, so the index of the totally positive
units inside `(𝓞 K)ˣ` need not equal `2 ^ r₁`: it is a genuine arithmetic invariant, and the gap
between it and `2 ^ r₁` is exactly what the narrow class group measures.

## Main results

* `NumberField.fieldUnitSignature_surjective`: every sign pattern at the real places is the
  signature of an element of `Kˣ`.
* `NumberField.quotientTotallyPositiveUnitsEquiv`: `Kˣ ⧸ totallyPositiveUnits` is the sign
  group.
* `NumberField.index_totallyPositiveUnits`: the totally positive elements have index
  `2 ^ nrRealPlaces K` in `Kˣ`.

## References

The statement that `Kˣ` realizes every sign pattern is the archimedean half of weak approximation;
see J. Neukirch, *Algebraic Number Theory*, Chapter I, and the discussion of the narrow class group
in H. Cohn, *A Classical Invitation to Algebraic Numbers and Class Fields*.

/-- **The signature map of a number field is surjective.** Every assignment of a sign to each real
place of `K` is realized by an element of `Kˣ`.

This is weak approximation at the real places; it says nothing about the signatures realized by the
units of `𝓞 K`, which form a genuinely smaller subgroup in general. -/
