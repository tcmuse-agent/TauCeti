# The degree of a cyclotomic extension of a number field

Mathlib computes the degree of an `m`-th cyclotomic extension either over `ℚ`
(`IsCyclotomicExtension.Rat.finrank`) or over a base for which the `m`-th cyclotomic polynomial
is already known to be irreducible (`IsCyclotomicExtension.finrank`). Neither is directly usable
over a general number field `K`, where irreducibility of `Φ_m` over `K` is exactly what has to be
established.

This file supplies the arithmetic criterion: if `m` is coprime to the discriminant of `K`, then

`[M : K] = φ m`   for `M / K` an `m`-th cyclotomic extension with `K` a number field.

The mechanism is linear disjointness rather than a direct irreducibility argument. Inside `M`,
the two subfields `ℚ(ζ)` and (the image of) `K` have coprime discriminants, so Mathlib's
`NumberField.linearDisjoint_of_isGalois_isCoprime_discr` makes them linearly disjoint; their
compositum is `M`, so the degree of `M` over `K` equals the degree of `ℚ(ζ)` over `ℚ`, which is
`φ m`. Coprimality of the discriminants is where the hypothesis is spent, via the divisibility
input below.

## Main results

* `IsCyclotomicExtension.Rat.prime_dvd_of_dvd_natAbs_discr`: a prime dividing the discriminant
  of an `m`-th cyclotomic field divides `m`. This is the divisibility input that turns
  coprimality to `m` into coprimality of discriminants.
* `IsCyclotomicExtension.finrank_eq_totient`: the degree identity `[M : K] = φ m`.

## Implementation notes

The hypothesis is `((NumberField.discr K).natAbs).Coprime m`, a statement about the *base*
field. It is the condition an arithmetic caller can actually arrange — e.g. by choosing `m` to
be a prime unramified in `K` — whereas the resulting intersection or irreducibility conditions
would have to be re-derived from it at each use.

Only the base `K` carries a `NumberField` hypothesis. `M` is finite over `K` by
`IsCyclotomicExtension.finiteDimensional`, hence a number field on its own, so demanding
`[NumberField M]` of the caller would be an avoidable hypothesis. The degree itself comes from
linear disjointness of `ℚ(ζ)` and the image of `K` inside `M`, whose compositum is `M`.

/-- **The cyclotomic degree over a number field base.** If `M / K` is an `m`-th cyclotomic
extension with `K` a number field and `m` coprime to `discr K`, then `[M : K] = φ m`.

Coprimality to `discr K` stands in for irreducibility of `Φ_m` over `K`, and is the hypothesis
an arithmetic caller can arrange directly. Only the base `K` need be a number field. -/
