# The ramified primes of a cyclotomic extension of a number field

Let `M / K` be an `m`-th cyclotomic extension with `K` a number field. The level `m` lies in the
different ideal of `𝓞 M` over `𝓞 K` — equivalently, that different divides `(m)` — so
ramification in `M / K` is confined to the primes above `m`. Read through absolute discriminants,
along the factorisation `|discr M| = 𝔑 𝔡(𝓞 M / 𝓞 K) * |discr K| ^ [M : K]`, the same bound says
that a rational prime dividing `discr M` divides `discr K` or divides `m`: the extension ramifies
only below or at the level.

Neither statement constrains `m` against `K`. In that they differ from the degree identity
`[M : K] = φ m` of `TauCeti.NumberTheory.NumberField.Cyclotomic.Finrank`, which needs `m` coprime
to `discr K` and fails outright when `K` already contains a primitive `m`-th root of unity.

## Main results

* `IsCyclotomicExtension.natCast_mem_differentIdeal`: the level `m` lies in the different ideal
  of `𝓞 M` over `𝓞 K`.
* `IsCyclotomicExtension.isUnramifiedAt_of_natCast_notMem`: primes above an ideal not
  containing the level are unramified.
* `IsCyclotomicExtension.prime_dvd_natAbs_discr_or_dvd_of_dvd_natAbs_discr`: a prime dividing
  `discr M` divides `discr K` or divides `m` — the extension ramifies only below or at the level.

## Implementation notes

`natCast_mem_differentIdeal` reads as a membership rather than as a divisibility of
`Ideal.span {(m : 𝓞 M)}`; `Ideal.span_singleton_le_iff_mem` gives the divisibility form where
that is the one wanted.

These results ask `M` to be a number field alongside `K`. That is no restriction, since a
cyclotomic extension of a number field is one: `IsCyclotomicExtension.numberField {m} K M`.
