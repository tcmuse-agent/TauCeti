# The cyclotomic compositum `M = L(μ_m)` and its joint restriction isomorphism

Let `L / K` be a Galois extension of number fields and let `M = L(μ_m)` be obtained from `L`
by adjoining the `m`-th roots of unity. When `m` is coprime to the discriminant of `L`, the
two restriction maps out of `Gal(M/K)` — to `Gal(L/K)`, and to `(ZMod m)ˣ` via the cyclotomic
character — are *jointly* bijective:

`Gal(M/K) ≃* Gal(L/K) × (ZMod m)ˣ`.

## Main results

* `IsCyclotomicExtension.isGalois_of_isGalois_of_isCyclotomicExtension`: `M / K` is itself
  Galois, so `Gal(M/K)` below is not an extra assumption.
* `IsPrimitiveRoot.autToPow_bijective`: the cyclotomic character
  `Gal(M/L) → (ZMod m)ˣ` is bijective.
* `IsCyclotomicExtension.restrictNormalHom_prod_autToPow_injective`: the joint restriction
  is faithful (no arithmetic hypothesis needed).
* `IsCyclotomicExtension.galEquivProd`: that map packaged as a `MulEquiv`, with
  `IsCyclotomicExtension.galEquivProd_apply` computing both of its components, and
  `IsCyclotomicExtension.restrictNormal_galEquivProd_symm` together with
  `IsCyclotomicExtension.autToPow_galEquivProd_symm` eliminating its inverse. Those three
  `simp` lemmas are the whole interface: no consumer needs the `MulEquiv.ofBijective` that
  packages the equivalence, in either direction.
* `IsCyclotomicExtension.ker_autToPow_eq_comap_galEquivProd` and
  `IsCyclotomicExtension.ker_restrictNormalHom_eq_comap_galEquivProd`: the same interface one
  level up, on subgroups rather than elements — each component's kernel is what `galEquivProd`
  reads off as the opposite factor.

The two general prerequisites this rests on are stated where they belong rather than here:
the degree identity `[M : K] = φ m` is `IsCyclotomicExtension.finrank_eq_totient` in
`TauCeti.NumberTheory.NumberField.Cyclotomic.Finrank`, and the compositum step
`K(ζ) ⊔ L = ⊤` is `TauCeti.IntermediateField.adjoin_sup_fieldRange_eq_top` in
`TauCeti.FieldTheory.IntermediateField.Adjoin.EqTop`.

## Implementation notes

The file is split by hypothesis strength, in three steps.
`restrictNormalHom_prod_autToPow_injective` comes first and assumes only `[Normal K L]`:
normality is exactly what defines
`AlgEquiv.restrictNormalHom L`, and the faithfulness argument never separates anything, so
requiring `IsGalois K L` there would be an avoidable hypothesis. Next
`isGalois_of_isGalois_of_isCyclotomicExtension` turns on `[IsGalois K L]`, needing no hypothesis
beyond the tower itself (algebraicity and separability of `M / K` are both derived inside the
proof from `IsGalois K L` and the cyclotomic tower). Both are pure field theory and carry no
`NumberField` instances. Only the results downstream of the degree count, which mention
`discr L`, take number fields.

`isGalois_of_isGalois_of_isCyclotomicExtension` is a theorem and not an `instance` because
neither `L` nor `m` can be recovered from the goal `IsGalois K M`, so there is no synthesization
order for it; call sites introduce it with `have`.

That `M / K` is Galois is *derived*, not assumed: `M` is the compositum of `L` with `K(ζ)`,
both of which are normal over `K`, and the engine for a compositum of two normal extensions is
Mathlib's `IntermediateField.normal_sup`. So `Gal(M/K)` below rests on no hypothesis beyond
`IsGalois K L` and the cyclotomic tower. Separability comes from transitivity along the same
tower: `L / K` is separable because it is Galois, and `M / L` because a cyclotomic extension is
(`IsCyclotomicExtension.isSeparable`). No characteristic assumption is needed, since a primitive
`m`-th root of unity exists in `M` only if the characteristic does not divide `m`.

Faithfulness of the joint restriction is *not* re-derived here: it is Mathlib's compositum
engine `IntermediateField.fixingSubgroup_sup` (with `fixingSubgroup_top`), applied to `K(ζ)`
and the image of `L` inside `M`. We invoke that shared lemma rather than
`IntermediateField.restrictRestrictAlgEquivMapHom_injective`, which is built from it, because
the latter concerns `Gal(M/L) →* Gal(K(ζ)/K)` whereas the map here is defined on `Gal(M/K)`;
using it would first require transporting an element of `Gal(M/K)` that fixes `L` into
`Gal(M/L)`, which is strictly more work than calling the underlying lemma directly.

Surjectivity does go through a degree count. That is not an oversight: surjectivity onto the
`(ZMod m)ˣ` factor *is* the assertion that the `m`-th cyclotomic polynomial stays irreducible
over `L`, which is exactly what the coprimality hypothesis `hcop` buys. Mathlib's companion
`restrictRestrictAlgEquivMapHom_surjective` needs `K(ζ) ⊓ L = ⊥`, and the proof of that
intersection statement is the same discriminant input, so it would not avoid the arithmetic.
