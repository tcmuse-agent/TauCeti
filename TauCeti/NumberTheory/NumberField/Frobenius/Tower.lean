# Raising the base field: the tower formula for arithmetic Frobenius elements

Let `K ⊆ M ⊆ L` be number fields with `L / K` and `L / M` Galois, let `Q` be a prime of `𝓞 L`
unramified over `𝓞 K`, and write `𝔓 = Q ∩ 𝓞 M` and `𝔭 = Q ∩ 𝓞 K`. An arithmetic Frobenius
`σ ∈ Gal(L/K)` at `Q` acts on the residue field by `x ↦ x ^ 𝔑𝔭`, while an arithmetic Frobenius
`τ ∈ Gal(L/M)` at `Q` acts by `x ↦ x ^ 𝔑𝔓`. Since `𝔑𝔓 = 𝔑𝔭 ^ f(𝔓/𝔭)`, the two are related by

```text
AlgEquiv.restrictScalars K τ = σ ^ f(𝔓/𝔭).
```

The exponent is a **power**, the residue degree of the intermediate prime over the base, and never
an inverse. In particular `σ ^ f(𝔓/𝔭)` fixes `M` pointwise even though `M / K` need not be normal
and `σ` itself need not preserve `M`.

This is the second of the two tower laws for Frobenius elements. The first, restriction along a
normal subextension, takes no power at all and is
`IsArithFrobAt.restrictNormal` in `TauCeti.NumberTheory.NumberField.Frobenius.Restriction`.

## The two hypotheses that are not decoration

The statement is *relative to one prime `Q` of `L`*. Replacing `σ` by an arbitrary conjugate — an
arbitrary representative of the Artin class of `𝔭` — makes it false when `M / K` is not normal: a
conjugate need not stabilize `Q`, so its `f`-th power need not fix `M` pointwise, and it is then
the restriction of no element of `Gal(L/M)` at all.

Unramifiedness of `Q` over `𝓞 K` is likewise essential. At a ramified prime a Frobenius lift is
determined only modulo inertia, so there is no equality of automorphisms to prove; the statement
would have to be made in the quotient by the inertia subgroup, or about a coset. Here
unramifiedness enters through `Ideal.stabilizerHom_injective_of_isUnramifiedAt`: the decomposition
group of `Q` embeds into the automorphism group of the residue extension, so an element of
`Gal(L/K)` stabilizing `Q` is pinned down by its residue action, and both `σ ^ f(𝔓/𝔭)` and
`AlgEquiv.restrictScalars K τ` act by `x ↦ x ^ 𝔑𝔓`.

## Main results

* `NumberField.restrictScalars_eq_pow_inertiaDeg`: an arithmetic Frobenius of `Gal(L/M)` at `Q`
  restricts to the `f(𝔓/𝔭)`-th power of an arithmetic Frobenius of `Gal(L/K)` at `Q`.
* `NumberField.isArithFrobAt_iff_restrictScalars_eq_pow_inertiaDeg`: that power characterizes the
  relative Frobenius among the elements of `Gal(L/M)` after restriction to `Gal(L/K)`.
* `NumberField.restrictScalars_arithFrobAt_eq_pow_inertiaDeg`: the same formula for Mathlib's
  coherently chosen `arithFrobAt`, which is what the Artin symbol is built from.
* `NumberField.exists_isArithFrobAt_pow_inertiaDeg`: the existence form of the tower formula,
  stated for prime ideals `𝔓` and `𝔭` presented by their defining equations.
* `NumberField.pow_inertiaDeg_apply_algebraMap`: the `f(𝔓/𝔭)`-th power of `σ` fixes `M`
  pointwise.
* `NumberField.restrictScalars_eq_of_inertiaDeg_eq_one`: at residue degree one the restriction
  of the relative Frobenius is `σ` itself, with no power.
* `NumberField.isArithFrobAt_restrictScalars_of_inertiaDeg_eq_one`: the same at residue degree
  one, concluding that the restriction is an arithmetic Frobenius rather than assuming one.
* `NumberField.isArithFrobAt_int_of_absNorm_eq`: a relative Frobenius above an ideal of absolute
  norm `p` is also a Frobenius over the ideal `(p)` of `ℤ`.
* `NumberField.isArithFrobAt_one_of_pow_eq_one` and
  `NumberField.isArithFrobAt_eq_one_of_pow_eq_one`: when an absolute Frobenius at `Q` has order
  dividing `n` and the residue field of `Q ∩ 𝓞 M` has `p ^ n` elements, the relative Frobenius
  of `Gal(L/M)` at `Q` is the identity.

Let `P` be an ideal of a number field `K` above `(p)` with absolute norm `p`. If `Q` lies above
`P`, then a Frobenius at `Q` relative to `K` is also a Frobenius relative to `ℤ` after
restricting its automorphism from `K`-linearity to `ℚ`-linearity.

The norm equality makes the two residue cardinalities in the definitions equal; no primality
hypothesis on `p`, `P`, or `Q` is required. -/

/-- **Raising the base field raises the Frobenius to the residue degree.** For number fields
`K ⊆ M ⊆ L` with `L / K` and `L / M` Galois and `Q` a prime of `𝓞 L` unramified over `𝓞 K`, the
restriction to `Gal(L/K)` of an arithmetic Frobenius `τ ∈ Gal(L/M)` at `Q` is the
`f(𝔓/𝔭)`-th power of an arithmetic Frobenius `σ ∈ Gal(L/K)` at `Q`, where
`𝔓 = Q ∩ 𝓞 M` and `𝔭 = Q ∩ 𝓞 K`.

The exponent is the residue degree of `𝔓` over `𝓞 K`, and it is a power: the residue field of `𝔓`
has `𝔑𝔭 ^ f(𝔓/𝔭)` elements, so the two Frobenius elements have residue actions `x ↦ x ^ 𝔑𝔭` and
`x ↦ x ^ 𝔑𝔭 ^ f(𝔓/𝔭)`. Both sides are read inside `Gal(L/K)`, where `τ` is placed by
`AlgEquiv.restrictScalars`. -/
