# The narrow class group of a number field

The **narrow class group** `Cl⁺(K)` of a number field `K` is the group of invertible fractional
ideals of `𝓞 K` modulo the principal ones admitting a **totally positive** generator. It refines the
ordinary class group `Cl(K)`, which quotients by *all* principal ideals: forgetting the positivity
condition on generators gives a surjection `Cl⁺(K) → Cl(K)`.

This construction adapts Mathlib's `ClassGroup` (`Mathlib.RingTheory.ClassGroup.Basic`): where
`ClassGroup R` is `(FractionalIdeal R⁰ (FractionRing R))ˣ ⧸ (toPrincipalIdeal R _).range`, the
narrow class group quotients the invertible fractional ideals over `K` by the *smaller* subgroup
`narrowPrincipalSubgroup` of principal ideals with a totally positive generator.

The narrow class group is the object whose `2`-rank the genus-theory `t - 1` formula computes for a
real quadratic field (Layer 3 of the multiquadratic roadmap); for imaginary fields, where every unit
is totally positive (there are no real places), `Cl⁺(K)` and `Cl(K)` coincide.

## Main definitions and results

* `NumberField.narrowPrincipalSubgroup`: the subgroup of principal fractional ideals with a
  totally positive generator, with `mem_narrowPrincipalSubgroup`.
* `NumberField.NarrowClassGroup`: the quotient `Cl⁺(K)`, a `CommGroup`.
* `NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.mk`: the class of an invertible fractional ideal, with
  `mk_surjective`, `mk_eq_one_iff`, `mk_eq_mk_iff`, and the eliminator `induction`.
* `NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.lift`: the universal property — a homomorphism trivial on
  `narrowPrincipalSubgroup` descends to `Cl⁺(K)`, with `lift_mk` and `lift_unique`.
* `NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.toClassGroup`: the surjection `Cl⁺(K) → Cl(K)` forgetting
  positivity, with `toClassGroup_surjective`.
* `NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.mkPrincipal` and `toClassGroup_ker`: the principal-class map
  `Kˣ → Cl⁺(K)` and exactness at `Cl⁺(K)` of `Kˣ → Cl⁺(K) → Cl(K) → 1`
  (`ker toClassGroup = mkPrincipal.range`), with the triviality criterion
  `mkPrincipal_eq_one_iff`.
* `NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.mkPrincipal_sq` and `sq_eq_one_of_mem_ker_toClassGroup`:
  `mkPrincipal` is `2`-torsion, so `ker(Cl⁺ → Cl)` is an elementary abelian `2`-group.
* `NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.mkPrincipal_eq_one_of_isTotallyPositive` and
  `NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.mkPrincipal_neg`: the principal class is trivial on totally
  positive generators and blind to the sign of its generator.
* `NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.mk0`: the narrow class of a nonzero integral ideal, with
  `toClassGroup_mk0`, `mk0_surjective`, the triviality criterion `mk0_eq_one_iff`,
  the `2`-torsion of principal classes
  `mk0_sq_eq_one_of_eq_span_singleton`, `mkPrincipal_coe_eq_mk0`, and the comparison
  `mk0_eq_mk0_iff`.
