# The `q`-expansion as a linear map, and uniqueness of coefficients for raw functions

The `q`-expansion of modular forms for a determinant-one subgroup of `GL(2, ℝ)`, bundled as
a `ℂ`-linear map into power series, refining Mathlib's additive `ModularForm.qExpansionAddHom`.

Alongside it, the raw-function form of Mathlib's coefficient-uniqueness statement. Mathlib's
`UpperHalfPlane.qExpansion_coeff_unique` is stated for a bundled `f : F` with
`[FunLike F ℍ ℂ]`, and `ℍ → ℂ` carries no such instance, so an operator built as a plain
function on `ℍ` — every Hecke-style slash sum before it is packaged as a `ModularForm` — cannot
invoke it. The proof is Mathlib's, run through `UpperHalfPlane.hasFPowerSeriesOnBall_cuspFunction`,
which *is* stated for `{f : ℍ → ℂ}`, with `qExpansionFormalMultilinearSeries` spelled out
inline for the same reason.

Alongside them, the `n`-th coefficient bundled as a `ℂ`-linear functional on *cusp* forms,
`CuspForm.qExpansionCoeffₗ` — the linear map above, composed with the inclusion of cusp forms
and with `PowerSeries.coeff n`. It is what a coefficient computation on a linear combination of
cusp forms is run through, and `CuspForm.qExpansion_injective` turns the resulting coefficient
identity back into an identity of cusp forms.

Alongside those, the effect of a `1 / d` translation on the `q`-powers a support condition
leaves alive: shifting the argument by `1 / d` scales the `n`-th `q`-power by a `d`-th root of
unity raised to `n`, so a coefficient function supported on the multiples of `d` does not see the
shift. That is what a `q`-support hypothesis is spent on when descending along `V_d`, and it is
stated here rather than at the descent because it mentions only coefficients, divisibility and
`Function.Periodic.qParam`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.ModularForm.qExpansionLinearMap`.
* `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.qExpansion_coeff_unique`.
* `CuspForm.qExpansionCoeffₗ` (at root, so dot notation on `CuspForm` elaborates): the `n`-th
  coefficient as a `ℂ`-linear functional on cusp forms.
* `CuspForm.qExpansion_injective`: a cusp form is determined by its `q`-expansion.
* `TauCeti.smul_qParam_pow_shift_eq`: a shift by `1 / d` fixes every `q`-power that a
  `d`-supported coefficient function leaves alive.
