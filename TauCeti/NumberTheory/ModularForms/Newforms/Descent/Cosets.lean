# The descent matrices at a prime

Miyake's level descent at a prime `p` runs over the `p` upper-triangular matrices `[1, v; 0, p]`
together with, when `p` divides `N` but `p²` does not, one further matrix built from an element
of `Γ₀(N / p)` reducing to `S = [[0, -1], [1, 0]]` modulo `p` and to the identity modulo `N / p`.
This file supplies that extra matrix, assembles the family of `p` or `p + 1` elements of `GL₂(ℝ)`
the descent runs over, and computes their determinants.

The extra matrix comes from strong approximation at a coprime pair of levels,
`CongruenceSubgroup.exists_mem_Gamma_map_intCast_zmod_eq`: for coprime `d` and `d'` the principal
congruence subgroup `Γ(d')` still surjects onto `SL₂(ℤ/dℤ)`. The descent is that statement at
`d = p` and `d' = N / p` — a coprime pair exactly because `p` divides `N` while `p²` does not —
with `S` as the prescribed reduction modulo `p`. Approximation returns membership in `Γ(N / p)`,
which is stronger than the `Γ₀(N / p)` the descent asks for, so the second reduction is the
identity rather than merely lower-triangular.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.descendMatrixCount`: the size of the family, `p` when `p² ∣ N` and `p + 1` otherwise.
* `TauCeti.descendExtraGamma`: the extra matrix, with the junk value `1` outside the hypotheses
  that make the choice.
* `TauCeti.descendMatrixRat`: the family before the embedding into `GL₂(ℝ)`, indexed by
  `Fin (descendMatrixCount p N)`.
* `TauCeti.descendMatrix`: the family itself, the image of `descendMatrixRat` in `GL₂(ℝ)`
  (`descendMatrix_eq_map`); `descendMatrixRat_of_lt`/`descendMatrixRat_of_le` and
  `descendMatrix_of_lt`/`descendMatrix_of_le` describe the members, and `descendMatrixRat_det`/
  `descendMatrix_det` their determinant.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_mem_Gamma0_map_intCast_zmod_eq_S`: for a prime `p` with `p ∣ N` and `p² ∤ N`,
  some `γ ∈ Γ₀(N / p)` reduces to `S` modulo `p` and to the identity modulo `N / p`.
* `TauCeti.descendExtraGamma_mem_Gamma0`, `TauCeti.descendExtraGamma_map_intCast_zmod_eq_S` and
  `TauCeti.descendExtraGamma_map_intCast_zmod_div_eq_one`: those three properties, read back off
  the chosen matrix.
* `TauCeti.descendExtraGamma_eq_one_of_not`: outside the hypotheses that make the choice, the
  extra matrix is the identity.
* `TauCeti.descendMatrixCount_of_sq_dvd` and `TauCeti.descendMatrixCount_of_not_sq_dvd`: the two
  values of the count.
* `TauCeti.descendMatrix_of_lt` and `TauCeti.descendMatrix_of_le`: the two branches of the
  family, as equations in `GL₂(ℝ)`.
* `TauCeti.descendMatrix_det`: every member of the family has determinant `p`.
* `TauCeti.descendMatrix_det_pos`: that determinant is positive, which is what the slash action
  needs to pull a scalar through a member of the family.

## Scope

The family is defined and its determinants computed. That its members *are* a set of coset
representatives, and that the associated slash sum descends the level, are separate statements
about the double coset `Γ₀(N) diag(1, p) Γ₀(N)`; neither is proved here. Until they are, the
family is the intended list of representatives rather than a formalized one.

Follows the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project, whose `descendExtraGamma`, `descendCosetCount`,
`descendCosetList` and `descendCosetList_det` are the counterparts of the declarations here — the
names differ because nothing here proves these matrices are coset representatives — and
specializes its `descendExtraGamma_exists`
(`LeanModularForms/StrongMultiplicityOne/DescentCosets.lean`, Chris Birkbeck, commit
`2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08`, Apache-2.0,
<https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB/tree/main/projects/LeanModularForms>), which proves the
same existence directly; here it is read off the general coprime-level statement instead.

/-- **A matrix with prescribed reductions at `p` and at `N / p`.** For a prime `p` with `p ∣ N` but
`p² ∤ N`, there is a `γ ∈ Γ₀(N / p)` reducing to `S = [[0, -1], [1, 0]]` modulo `p` and to the
identity modulo `N / p`.

`p² ∤ N` is exactly what makes `p` coprime to `N / p`; the target modulo `p` is `S`, and membership
in `Γ₀(N / p)` comes from the stronger `Γ(N / p)` that
`CongruenceSubgroup.exists_mem_Gamma_map_intCast_zmod_eq` already delivers.

This is the matrix Miyake's Lemma 4.5.11 takes as its extra coset representative for the level
descent when `p` exactly divides `N`. Only existence and the two reductions are proved here: the
coset system is not formalized, so nothing is claimed about enumerating or completing it. -/

/-- **The descent family at `p`, over `ℚ`** (Miyake, Lemma 4.5.11): a family in `GL₂(ℚ)` made of
the `p` upper-triangular matrices `upperTriRep p v = [1, v; 0, p]` for `v < p` — this
repository's `T_p` representative family — together with, when `p²` does not divide `N`, so
that `descendMatrixCount` is `p + 1`, the further matrix `[1, 0; 0, p] * mapGL ℚ γ_p`, where
`γ_p = descendExtraGamma p N` is embedded into `GL₂(ℚ)` by `mapGL ℚ`.

Neither `p ∣ N` nor primality of `p` is required: the construction uses only `p ≠ 0`, to name the
zero index of `Fin p`. Those two hypotheses are what make the family the *descent* family at a
prime — without `p ∣ N` the matrix `descendExtraGamma p N` is `1` and the extra member degenerates
to `[1, 0; 0, p]`, which the first branch already lists at `v = 0` — so they belong on the later
results that establish descent, not on the family itself. -/
