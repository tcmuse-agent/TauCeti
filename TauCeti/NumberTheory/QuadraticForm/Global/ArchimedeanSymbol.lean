# The archimedean Hilbert symbol

The archimedean symbol is the norm-equation Hilbert symbol read over the completion at an infinite
place.  This module records that symbol for *global* units at the *places of a number field*, the
square criterion for a global unit at a real place, and the real-place half of the sign
prescription.

At a real place the symbol of two elements is `-1` exactly when both are negative there, and `1`
exactly when one of them is positive there.  A product of such symbols over a prescribed set of
real places is therefore a product of signs, and the bimultiplicativity it needs is that of
`TauCeti.hilbertSymbol_real_mul_left` and `TauCeti.hilbertSymbol_real_mul_right`, in
`TauCeti.NumberTheory.HilbertSymbol.Archimedean`; both are `[simp]`, so `simp` expands a
product of global units inside the localized symbol.
At a complex place the symbol is `1` for the same reason the
archimedean classification of a form is by rank alone: every element of `ℂˣ` is a square, so
`TauCeti.hilbertSymbol_eq_one_of_isAlgClosed`, in
`TauCeti.NumberTheory.HilbertSymbol.IsAlgClosed`, already settles the complex places of a number
field and the real places alone decide such a product.

The real-place half of the sign prescription of O'Meara 71:19 is recorded as well.  Given a
prescribed element `b` that is a nonsquare at a real place,
`exists_hilbertSymbol_eq_neg_one_atRealPlace` turns it into a local non-norm, which is what a
sign-prescription argument needs at each place of its set; a field unit negative at every real
place is such a `b`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.hilbertSymbol_unitAtRealPlace_eq_neg_one_iff` and
  `TauCeti.hilbertSymbol_unitAtRealPlace_eq_one_iff`: the archimedean symbol of two global units
  at a real place, in both signs.
* Bimultiplicativity, by which the symbols at the real places of a prescribed set can be
  multiplied, is `TauCeti.hilbertSymbol_real_mul_left` and
  `TauCeti.hilbertSymbol_real_mul_right` read at a place; both are `[simp]`, so `simp` expands a
  product of global units inside a localized symbol.
* `TauCeti.isSquare_unitAtRealPlace_iff` and `TauCeti.not_isSquare_unitAtRealPlace_iff`: a
  global unit is a square at a real place exactly when it is positive there.
* `TauCeti.exists_hilbertSymbol_eq_neg_one_atRealPlace`: a *prescribed* negative global unit at a
  real place has a negative partner with symbol `-1` there.

## A value-group convention

The value group of `HeightOneSpectrum.valuation` is `WithZero (Multiplicative ℤ)`, whose
multiplicative identity `1` is the value zero, that is, order of vanishing zero.  So
`v.valuation K x = 1` says that `x` is a local unit at `v`, while an element of order of vanishing
`1` is written `WithZero.exp (-1)`, the value of a generator of `v.asIdeal`; the additive order of
vanishing of an element is the negative logarithm of its value, as
`IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.neg_log_valuation_eq_one_iff` records.  A criterion phrased
with the hypothesis `v.valuation K (a : K) = 1` would therefore be false, and `a = 1` is the
counterexample: its image in the completion is the unit `1`, which is a square.

The finite-place nonsquare criterion that does hold is
`IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.not_isSquare_adicCompletion_of_valuation_eq_exp_of_not_even`:
an element of odd order of vanishing is a nonsquare in the completion, and the prime of a
prescribed modulus supplies an element of that kind.  Here `Kˣ` is the group of all nonzero
elements of `K`, not the unit group of the ring of integers, so a field unit of odd order of
vanishing at a finite place is a nonsquare in its completion by that criterion, exactly as any
other element of odd order of vanishing is.  The criterion is one way to obtain a nonsquare and
not a description of all of them; in particular it says nothing about the local units, which are
the case `v.valuation K x = 1`.

/-- **A prescribed negative global unit at a real place has a partner with symbol `-1`.**

Given the element `b` whose local nonsquareness a sign-prescription argument presupposes, there is
a global unit `a` whose symbol with `b` at `w` is `-1`, and `a` is negative there.  Both operands
are read at the same real place, so that the symbol can be multiplied with the symbols at the
other places of the prescribed set.  This is the step that turns a prescribed nonsquare into a
local non-norm. -/
