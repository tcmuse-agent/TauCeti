# The ideal weight of a Galois character

For a finite Galois extension `L / K` of number fields and a character `χ : Gal(L/K) →* ℂˣ`, this
file builds the *canonical ideal weight* `galoisCharacterWeight χ`: the completely multiplicative
function on the ideals of `𝓞 K` whose value at a height-one prime `𝔭` is `χ (Frob 𝔭)` when `𝔭` is
unramified in `L`, and `0` when `𝔭` ramifies. Since `Gal(L/K)` is finite those unramified values
are roots of unity, so the same weight is packaged a second time as a
`TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight K`.

Nothing here assumes that `L / K` is cyclotomic: the construction needs only `[IsGalois K L]`, and
the character is an arbitrary degree-one complex character of the Galois group. The Dirichlet
weight is the specialisation `L / K = ℚ(ζ_m) / ℚ`, where the cyclotomic character identifies
`Gal(ℚ(ζ_m)/ℚ)` with `(ZMod m)ˣ` and `χ` is a Dirichlet character mod `m`. Over a general base `K`
that character is still injective but need not be surjective: restriction identifies
`Gal(K(ζ_m)/K)` with the subgroup of `(ZMod m)ˣ` fixing `K ∩ ℚ(ζ_m)`, and that subgroup is all of
`(ZMod m)ˣ` exactly when `K ∩ ℚ(ζ_m) = ℚ`. The declarations are named for the generality they
actually have.

The weight is **total**, and that is a design constraint rather than a convenience: a weight
specified only away from ramification leaves its values at the bad primes unconstrained, so the
Euler product and the orthogonality identities would not pin it down. Vanishing at the ramified
primes is what makes the ramified Euler factors drop out as `(1 - 0)⁻¹ = 1`.

## Main definitions

* `MonoidHom.galoisCharacterWeight`: the weight of `χ`, packaged as a
  `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight K`.
* `MonoidHom.galoisCharacterUnitaryWeight`: the same weight packaged as a
  `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight K`, its values having modulus `1` away from the ramified primes.

## Main results

* `MonoidHom.galoisCharacterWeight_apply_of_unramified`: at an unramified height-one prime the
  weight is `χ` of the Artin symbol.
* `MonoidHom.galoisCharacterWeight_apply_eq_zero_iff`: the weight vanishes at a height-one prime
  exactly when that prime ramifies in `L`.
* `MonoidHom.badPrimes_galoisCharacterWeight`: the bad primes of the weight are exactly the
  ramified primes.
* `MonoidHom.galoisCharacterWeight_one`: the weight of the trivial character is the indicator of
  the ideals prime to the ramified primes, so its `L`-series is the Dedekind zeta function with the
  ramified Euler factors deleted.
* `MonoidHom.galoisCharacterWeight_mul`: the weight of a product of characters is the product of
  their weights.
* `MonoidHom.val_galoisCharacterUnitaryWeight`: the unitary packaging has the same underlying
  weight.
* `MonoidHom.norm_galoisCharacterWeight_le_one`: the weight of a Galois character is bounded by
  `1`.
* `MonoidHom.summable_idealTerm_galoisCharacterWeight`: the ideal series of a Galois character
  converges absolutely on `Re s > 1`.

## Implementation notes

The weight is packaged as a `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight K` rather than as a bare function
`Ideal (𝓞 K) → ℂ`, so that the totality above is expressed in the carrier's own `badPrimes` API:
the bad primes of `χ.galoisCharacterWeight` are exactly `ramifiedPrimes K L`.

`TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight K` is the subtype of those multiplicative weights whose values have
modulus `1` away from the bad primes, so the unitary packaging records strictly more than the
multiplicative one and is not a replacement for it: `galoisCharacterWeight` remains the definition
everything else is stated about, and `val_galoisCharacterUnitaryWeight` is the bridge. Unitarity is
a property of the weight rather than of `χ`, so no hypothesis constrains `χ` itself to the unit
circle.
