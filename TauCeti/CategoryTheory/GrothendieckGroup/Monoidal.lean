# The tensor product makes split `K₀` a ring

The split Grothendieck group `TauCeti.SplitK0 C` of
`TauCeti/CategoryTheory/GrothendieckGroup/Split.lean` records the additive structure of a
category: `[X ⊞ Y] = [X] + [Y]`. When `C` also
carries a monoidal structure whose tensor product is additive in each factor
(`CategoryTheory.MonoidalPreadditive`), the tensor product descends to a multiplication on
`SplitK0 C` and makes it a ring, commutative as soon as `C` is braided.

The construction is entirely a matter of feeding the tensor product to the universal property
twice. For a fixed object `X`, tensoring on the left is an additive endofunctor of `C`, so
`TauCeti.SplitK0.map` turns it into an endomorphism of the group. Sending `X` to that
endomorphism is itself an isomorphism-invariant, biproduct-additive function of `X` -- additivity
in `X` is `TauCeti.SplitK0.map` applied to tensoring on the *right* -- so it
descends to `TauCeti.SplitK0.mulHom`, a biadditive multiplication with
`[X] * [Y] = [X ⊗ Y]`. Distributivity is then automatic, and the remaining ring axioms are the
associator, the unitors, and the braiding: each of them is an equality of bundled additive maps, so
it is checked on the classes of objects by `TauCeti.SplitK0.hom_ext`.

The multiplication is *not* obtained by a second presentation: no new relation is imposed, and the
underlying additive group is unchanged. In particular a biproduct-additive invariant into a ring
becomes a ring homomorphism `TauCeti.SplitK0.liftRingHom` exactly when it sends the tensor unit to
`1` and is multiplicative on the classes of objects, which is how character-style invariants are
recognized.

This is the ring structure the representation ring `R(G)` of a finite group carries. Split `K₀`
is the right home for it: the Grothendieck group of a semisimple category, such as the
finite-dimensional representations of a finite group over a field of characteristic zero, has no
relations beyond the biproduct ones, so the split group *is* the representation ring there.
Producing that instantiation additionally needs the smallness of the representation category,
which is a separate matter and is not proved here; nothing below assumes semisimplicity.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.SplitK0.mulHom C`: multiplication on split `K₀`, as a biadditive map.
* `TauCeti.SplitK0.instRing` and `TauCeti.SplitK0.instCommRing`: the ring structure, commutative
  for a braided category.
* `TauCeti.SplitK0.liftRingHom`: the ring homomorphism induced by a multiplicative, unit-preserving
  biproduct-additive invariant.
* `TauCeti.SplitK0.mapRingHom`: the ring homomorphism induced by a monoidal additive functor.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.SplitK0.of_mul_of`: the computation rule `[X] * [Y] = [X ⊗ Y]`, and
  `TauCeti.SplitK0.one_def`: the unit is the class of the tensor unit.
* `TauCeti.SplitK0.ringHom_ext`: two ring homomorphisms out of split `K₀` agreeing on the classes
  of objects are equal.
* `TauCeti.SplitK0.mapRingHom_id` and `TauCeti.SplitK0.mapRingHom_comp`: the induced ring
  homomorphism is functorial.

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.SplitK0.mulHom` is stated as a bundled `SplitK0 C →+ SplitK0 C →+ SplitK0 C` rather than
as a bare function, because biadditivity is exactly what makes the ring axioms checkable on the
classes of objects: associativity, commutativity, and multiplicativity of an induced map are each
an equality of bundled maps, so `TauCeti.SplitK0.hom_ext` reduces them to the classes of objects
with no additive bookkeeping left to do.

Tensoring on the left by a fixed object, and the two lemmas saying that it is an
isomorphism-invariant, biproduct-additive function of that object, are the input to the second use
of the universal property and have no role afterwards, so they are private: the public computation
rule is `TauCeti.SplitK0.of_mul_of`.

The `Mul` and `One` instances are installed before the `Ring` instance so that the axioms can be
stated in the usual notation; the `Ring` instance reuses them rather than introducing new
operations. Distributivity alone stages a private `NonUnitalNonAssocRing` structure, which is what
makes Mathlib's bundled `AddMonoidHom.mulLeft₃`, `AddMonoidHom.mulRight₃` and `AddMonoidHom.mul`
applicable to the remaining axioms. No axiom witness is exported under a `TauCeti.SplitK0` name:
each is a field of the instance it discharges, so the general lemmas `mul_assoc`, `one_mul`, ...
are the only ones to use.

/-! ### The ring structure

Distributivity is additivity of `TauCeti.SplitK0.mulHom` in each variable; it already stages a
`NonUnitalNonAssocRing` structure. The remaining axioms are then equalities of the bundled maps
`AddMonoidHom.mulLeft₃`, `AddMonoidHom.mulRight₃` and `AddMonoidHom.mul`, so
`TauCeti.SplitK0.hom_ext` reduces them to the classes of objects. -/

/-- Split `K₀` with the multiplication descended from the tensor product, before associativity and
the unit are available: each field is additivity of `TauCeti.SplitK0.mulHom` in one of its two
variables. This staging structure is what makes Mathlib's bundled multiplications
`AddMonoidHom.mulLeft₃`, `AddMonoidHom.mulRight₃` and `AddMonoidHom.mul` applicable, so that the
remaining ring axioms become equalities of additive maps. It is private, and the `Ring` instance
below therefore repeats its four one-line field proofs rather than extending it: the module system
exposes the value of an instance, which a private declaration may not enter. -/
