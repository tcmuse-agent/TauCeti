# The `p`-section indicator as a combination of characters

Fix a prime `p`, a finite group `G`, and an algebraically closed field `k` in which `|G|` is
invertible.
Brauer's induction theorem, which writes every character of `G` as an integral combination of
characters induced from elementary subgroups, is proved one prime at a time: for each `p` one
needs a function on `G` with natural-number values, none divisible by `p`, that is a combination
of characters induced from `p`-elementary subgroups. The coefficients of that combination need not
be integers; they lie in any subring `A ≤ k` containing the required roots of unity. The intended
later specialization takes `A` to be a ring of cyclotomic integers, from which descent to `ℤ` is a
separate step. This file constructs that function.

The building block is the `p`-section indicator of a `p`-regular element `s`
(`TauCeti.pSectionIndicator`), a class function on the `p`-elementary subgroup
`H = TauCeti.pElementaryOfSylow s P`. On the cyclic group `⟨s⟩` the indicator of `s` expands as
`|⟨s⟩|⁻¹ ∑ χ, χ(s⁻¹) χ` over the linear characters `χ`, whose values are roots of unity of order
dividing `orderOf s`; the section indicator is its pullback along the projection
`TauCeti.pFreePartHom : H →* ⟨s⟩`. So `orderOf s` times the section indicator is an
`A`-combination of characters of `H`, for every subring `A` of `k` containing those roots of
unity (`TauCeti.orderOf_nsmul_pSectionIndicator_mem_span_virtualCharacters`), and inducing it
gives an `A`-combination of virtual characters induced from `p`-elementary subgroups
(`TauCeti.orderOf_nsmul_indPSectionIndicator_mem_span_indVirtualCharacters`).

Summing these induced functions over the conjugacy classes of `p`-regular elements `s` gives the
function wanted: at `y` only the class of the `p`-free part of `y` contributes, with a value
`orderOf s` times a count of cosets that is prime to `p`
(`TauCeti.exists_mem_span_indVirtualCharacters_isPElementary_not_dvd`).

The scaling by `orderOf s`, rather than by the order of `H`, is what keeps the values prime to
`p`: expanding the section indicator directly on `H` would clear a denominator divisible by the
`p`-part of `|H|`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.pSectionIndicator_eq_comp_pFreePartHom`: the `p`-section indicator is the pullback of
  the indicator of `s` along the `p`-free-part homomorphism.
* `TauCeti.orderOf_nsmul_pSectionIndicator_mem_span_virtualCharacters`: `orderOf s` times the
  `p`-section indicator is an `A`-combination of characters of the `p`-elementary subgroup.
* `TauCeti.orderOf_nsmul_indPSectionIndicator_mem_span_indVirtualCharacters`: its induction is an
  `A`-combination of virtual characters induced from `p`-elementary subgroups.
* `TauCeti.exists_mem_span_indVirtualCharacters_isPElementary_not_dvd`: **there is a
  natural-number-valued function with no value divisible by `p` whose cast is such a
  combination.**
