# The exceptional character attached to a trivial-intersection subgroup

Let `H` be a trivial-intersection subgroup of a finite group `G` (`TauCeti.IsTISubgroup`): one
meeting each of its distinct conjugates trivially, as a Frobenius complement does.  Induction from
such an `H` is an isometry on the class functions that vanish at the identity
(`TauCeti.characterPairing_ind_ind`, whose support form is `TauCeti.isometry_ind_of_isTISet`), but
it does not send characters to characters: `Ind_H^G φ` has
degree `|G : H| · φ(1)`, not `φ(1)`.  The classical repair is to induce not `φ` but `φ` corrected by
a multiple of the trivial character, and to add that multiple back on `G`:

`φ* = Ind_H^G (φ - φ(1) · 1_H) + φ(1) · 1_G`.

This file builds that class function, `TauCeti.ClassFunction.indExtend H φ`, as a `k`-linear map in
`φ`, and proves what makes it useful.  It has the same degree
(`TauCeti.ClassFunction.indExtend_apply_one`) and **restricts back to `φ`**
(`TauCeti.ClassFunction.comap_subtype_indExtend`); and the assignment `φ ↦ φ*` **preserves the
character pairing**
(`TauCeti.ClassFunction.characterPairing_indExtend_indExtend`), so it carries a norm-`1` virtual
character of `H` to a norm-`1` virtual character of `G`.  Over an algebraically closed field of
characteristic zero in which `|G|` is invertible, a norm-`1` virtual character is `±` an irreducible
character, and the degree pins down the sign: `φ*` is an **irreducible character of `G`**
(`TauCeti.ClassFunction.indExtend_mem_irreducibleCharacters`).  Restriction inverts the assignment,
so `φ ↦ φ*` is injective (`TauCeti.ClassFunction.indExtend_injective`), and `Irr(H)` embeds into
`Irr(G)` with `Res_H φ* = φ`.

That embedding is the exceptional-character correspondence, the step at which the
character-theoretic proof of Frobenius's theorem produces the irreducible characters of `G` whose
common kernel is the Frobenius kernel.  Nothing here asserts that the kernel is a subgroup; that
uses the family of these characters and is a separate target.

## Why the correction term is needed

Two properties of `φ*` are in tension, and the correction is exactly what reconciles them.  The
pairing is preserved only for class functions vanishing at the identity — `Ind` is an isometry
*there*, and `Ind 1_H` has norm `#(H \ G / H)`, not `1` — while a character of `G` must take the
value `φ(1)` at the identity, and `Ind φ` takes `|G : H| · φ(1)`.  Subtracting `φ(1) · 1_H` before
inducing buys the first, and adding `φ(1) · 1_G` afterwards buys the second, without disturbing the
first: the trivial character of `G` is itself the extension of the trivial character of `H`, and the
cross terms cancel.  This is why `TauCeti.ClassFunction.characterPairing_indExtend_indExtend` is an
identity of pairings on the nose, with no error term.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ClassFunction.indExtend`: the `k`-linear map `φ ↦ φ*` above, with
  `TauCeti.ClassFunction.indExtend_def` its defining formula.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ClassFunction.comap_subtype_indExtend`: `Res_H φ* = φ`, and
  `TauCeti.ClassFunction.indExtend_apply_one`: `φ*(1) = φ(1)`.
* `TauCeti.ClassFunction.characterPairing_indExtend_indExtend`: `⟨φ*, ψ*⟩_G = ⟨φ, ψ⟩_H`.
* `TauCeti.ClassFunction.indExtend_ofCharacter_trivial`: the trivial character of `H` extends to the
  trivial character of `G`.
* `TauCeti.ClassFunction.indExtend_mem_virtualCharacters`: `φ*` is a virtual character of `G` when
  `φ` is one of `H` of integral degree.
* `TauCeti.ClassFunction.indExtend_mem_irreducibleCharacters`: **`φ*` is an irreducible character
  of `G` when `φ` is one of `H`**, and `TauCeti.ClassFunction.indExtend_injective`: distinct class
  functions have distinct extensions.

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.ClassFunction.indExtend` is bundled as a `k`-linear map, matching
`TauCeti.ClassFunction.ind`: the value at the identity is a linear functional of `φ`, so the
correction is linear in `φ` too, and the pairing identity then says exactly that the map is an
isometry for `TauCeti.ClassFunction.characterPairing`.  Because the definition is not exposed,
`TauCeti.ClassFunction.indExtend_def` records the defining formula for consumers.

The trivial character is spelled `TauCeti.ClassFunction.ofCharacter (Representation.trivial k _ k)`,
as elsewhere in this directory, rather than as a bundled constant function; the private lemmas
`comap_subtype_ofCharacter_trivial` and `characterPairing_ofCharacter_trivial_self` are what the
proofs need of it, and neither belongs in this file's interface.

`TauCeti.ClassFunction.indExtend_mem_virtualCharacters` carries the hypothesis that `φ(1)` is the
image of an integer.  That is not decoration: the correction term is the scalar multiple
`φ(1) · 1_G`, which lies in the virtual-character lattice — an additive subgroup, not a
`k`-submodule — only for an integral scalar.  For a virtual character `φ` over an algebraically
closed field the degree is automatically integral, and
`TauCeti.ClassFunction.indExtend_mem_irreducibleCharacters` discharges the hypothesis with the
degree of an irreducible character.

Both the induction isometry and the correction term are used, and the point is that the correction
costs nothing.  Writing `θ = φ - φ(1) · 1_H`, induction is an isometry on `θ` because `θ` vanishes
at the identity; the cross terms `⟨Ind θ, 1_G⟩` collapse to `⟨θ, 1_H⟩` by Frobenius reciprocity,
because the trivial character of `G` restricts to that of `H`; and `1_G` has norm `1`.  Expanding,
