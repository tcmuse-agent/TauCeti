# The dimension form of Clifford's theorem

Let `N` be a normal subgroup of a group `G` and let `W` be an irreducible finite-dimensional
representation of `G` over an algebraically closed field.  Clifford's theorem describes the
restriction of `W` to `N` as `e` copies of each of the `[G : inertia V]` distinct conjugates of
one irreducible constituent `V`.  Counting dimensions turns that description into the identity

`dim W = e * [G : inertia V] * dim V`,

so in particular the index of the inertia group divides `dim W`, and so does the dimension of the
constituent.  That index divides `[G : N]` as well, because `N ≤ inertia V`, so the number of
distinct conjugates occurring is constrained from two sides at once: by the degree of `W` and by
the index of `N`, neither constraint mentioning the multiplicity `e`.

Two special cases follow from that arithmetic.  Whenever `dim W` and `[G : N]` are **coprime** the
index is `1`: the inertia group is everything, there is a single constituent, and the character of
`W` on `N` is `e` times that of `V`.  A subgroup of index two and an irreducible of odd dimension
are coprime in that sense, which is the case arising for `alternatingGroup α ◁ Equiv.Perm α`,
complementary to the linear-character computation of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Induction/Clifford/Alternating.lean`, where the inertia group is as
*small* as Clifford theory allows.  And when `dim W = 1` the right-hand side of the dimension
identity is a product of natural numbers equal to `1`, so every factor is `1`: a linear character
of `G` restricts to a linear character of `N` that the whole group fixes.

## Main statements

* `FDRep.clifford_restrict_finrank`: **Clifford's theorem, dimension form**, packaging the
  constituent together with its decomposition of `Res_N W`, the multiplicity and the identity
  `dim W = e * [G : inertia V] * dim V` as natural numbers.
* `FDRep.clifford_restrict_dvd_finrank`: the divisibilities that identity contains,
  `[G : inertia V] ∣ dim W` and `dim V ∣ dim W`, together with `[G : inertia V] ∣ [G : N]` and the
  count `[G : inertia V] ∣ dim W / (e * dim V)` with the multiplicity divided out, stated for a
  constituent `V` supplied with its decomposition of `Res_N W`.
* `FDRep.clifford_restrict_inertia_eq_top_of_coprime`: when the dimension of `W` is **coprime**
  to `[G : N]`, the restriction of `W` to `N` is isomorphic to `e` copies of a single constituent
  `V` whose inertia group is all of `G`, the character of `W` on `N` being `e` times that of `V`
  and `dim W = e * dim V`.
* `FDRep.clifford_restrict_inertia_eq_top_of_finrank_eq_one`: a one-dimensional representation of
  `G` restricts to a one-dimensional representation of `N` whose inertia group is all of `G`, the
  restriction being a single copy of it.

/-- **Clifford's theorem, dimension form.**  The dimension of an irreducible representation of `G`
is the common multiplicity `e` of the constituents of its restriction to `N`, times the number
`[G : inertia V]` of those constituents, times the dimension of one of them.

The decomposition `Res_N W ≅ V.cliffordSum e` that `FDRep.clifford_restrict_iso` supplies is
returned alongside the identity, so that `V` is exhibited as a constituent of the restriction and
not merely named by it.

In particular the index of the inertia group of a constituent divides the dimension of `W`; that
is the arithmetic that `FDRep.clifford_restrict_dvd_finrank` reads off and that
`FDRep.clifford_restrict_inertia_eq_top_of_coprime` exploits. -/

/-- **The divisibilities in Clifford's theorem.**  For an irreducible constituent `V` of the
restriction of an irreducible `W` to a normal subgroup, both the index of the inertia group of `V`
and the dimension of `V` divide the dimension of `W`; the index divides `[G : N]`, and it divides
the quotient `dim W / (e * dim V)` that the dimension identity leaves.

The decomposition `Res_N W ≅ V.cliffordSum e` is carried along from
`FDRep.clifford_restrict_finrank`, so that `V` is exhibited as a constituent of the restriction and
the divisibilities are read as statements about that constituent rather than about some unrelated
irreducible representation of `N`.

This is the form in which the dimension identity of `FDRep.clifford_restrict_finrank` is used.  The
number of distinct conjugates occurring in the restriction is `[G : inertia V]`, and it is
constrained from two sides at once: by the degree of `W`, through the dimension identity, and by
the index of `N`, through `TauCeti.le_inertia`.  Neither constraint mentions the multiplicity `e`,
which the last divisibility divides out instead: `dim W / (e * dim V)` is the roadmap's form of the
count of distinct conjugates. -/

/-- **Clifford theory when the dimension is coprime to the index.**  If the dimension of an
irreducible `W : FDRep k G` is coprime to `[G : N]`, then `Res_N W` is isomorphic to `e` copies of
a single irreducible constituent `V` whose inertia group is all of `G`; consequently the character
of `W` on `N` is `e` times that of `V`, and `dim W = e * dim V`.

The number of constituents is the index `[G : inertia V]`, which divides `[G : N]` because
`N ≤ inertia V`, and divides `dim W` by the dimension identity that
`FDRep.clifford_restrict_finrank` records.  Coprimality leaves it no value but `1`, so
`inertia V = ⊤` and `V.cliffordSum e` has a single conjugate summand.

An irreducible of odd dimension over a subgroup of index two is the instance of this that arises
for `alternatingGroup α ◁ Equiv.Perm α`, complementary to
`TauCeti.inertia_ofLinearCharacter_alternatingGroup`, where a linear character of the alternating
group has the *smallest* inertia group instead. -/

/-- **A linear character restricts to an invariant linear character.**  If `W` is one-dimensional,
then an irreducible constituent of its restriction to a normal subgroup is one-dimensional and is
fixed by the conjugation action of the whole group, its inertia group being all of `G`.

The right-hand side of the dimension identity of `FDRep.clifford_restrict_finrank` is a product of
natural numbers, so its being `1` forces each of the three factors to be `1`.  The multiplicity is
therefore `1` too, and the decomposition `Res_N W ≅ V.cliffordSum 1` exhibiting `V` as the
constituent is returned alongside. -/
