# Induction, restriction, and virtual characters

This file records the compatibility of induction and of restriction along a subgroup with the
virtual-character lattice: both send virtual characters to virtual characters, because both send
characters to characters and both are additive.

Together they are the two maps `R(S) → R(G)` and `R(G) → R(S)` on virtual-character lattices whose
interplay -- the projection formula `TauCeti.indClassFun_comp_subtype_mul` -- makes induction a map
of `R(G)`-modules.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ClassFunction.indVirtualCharacterAddHom`: induction bundled as an additive
  homomorphism between the virtual-character lattices of a subgroup and the ambient group.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.ClassFunction.ind_ofFDRep_mem_virtualCharacters`: induction takes the character of a
  finite-dimensional subgroup representation to a virtual character of the ambient group.
* `TauCeti.indClassFun_mem_virtualCharacters`: the same for an arbitrary virtual character of the
  subgroup, obtained from the previous statement by additivity.
* `TauCeti.ClassFunction.indVirtualCharacterAddHom_apply_coe`: forgetting the target
  subtype in the bundled map recovers induction of class functions.
* `TauCeti.comp_subtype_mem_virtualCharacters`: restricting a virtual character of `G` to a
  subgroup gives a virtual character of the subgroup.

## References

This supplies a compatibility needed by the virtual-character and Artin-induction targets of

/-- **A character induced from a subgroup is a virtual character.**  Inducing the class function of
a finite-dimensional representation gives the class function of the induced representation
(`TauCeti.ClassFunction.ind_ofFDRep`), and a character is a virtual character.  This is deliberately
not a simp lemma: its left-hand side reduces through `ind_ofFDRep` to the existing
`TauCeti.character_mem_virtualCharacters` simp lemma. -/

/-- **Restriction preserves virtual characters.**  It is the pullback along the inclusion of the
subgroup, `TauCeti.comp_mem_virtualCharacters`; the restriction of a plain function is written
`fun s : S => f s`, and `TauCeti.ClassFunction.comap` is the class-function form.

This is the additive half of the statement that restriction `R(G) → R(S)` is a ring homomorphism;
its multiplicativity is the pointwise `TauCeti.mul_mem_virtualCharacters` on each side. -/

/-- **Induction preserves virtual characters.**  A character of the subgroup induces to a character
(`TauCeti.ClassFunction.ind_ofFDRep_mem_virtualCharacters`), and induction is additive, so the
property propagates through the additive generation of the lattice. -/
