# Weights add on a tensor product

A diagonal matrix acts on a pure tensor of weight vectors by the product of the two scalars, so a
tensor product of weight vectors is again a weight vector and its weight is the **sum** of the two
weights (`TauCeti.tmul_mem_weightSpace_tprod`). This file promotes that one-line computation to a
decomposition: once each factor is spanned by its weight spaces, so is the tensor product, and —
once distinct weights give distinct characters of the torus — its weight-`l` space is exactly the
sum of the products of the weight spaces of the factors over the pairs of weights adding up to
`l`.

The two directions are of quite different natures. The inclusion of the sum of products into the
weight space is the computation above and needs only a commutative ring, and so does the fact that
the weight spaces of the tensor product span it — that one is the distributivity of
`Submodule.map₂` over suprema, applied to `TensorProduct.map₂_mk_top_top_eq_top`. The reverse
inclusion is not a computation at all: it says that a weight vector of the tensor product has no
component outside the pieces just constructed, and that is read off the **independence** of the
weight spaces (`TauCeti.iSupIndep_weightSpace`) through
`iSupIndep.le_iff_eq_of_iSup_eq_top`. So it inherits the standing hypothesis of the weight theory,
that distinct weights give distinct characters of the torus, and with it the coefficients: over
`𝔽₂` the torus is trivial and nothing is independent.

The determinant powers are the worked case, and they need neither ingredient above. Because
`det ^ m` is the one-dimensional representation on which the torus acts by the character of the
constant weight `fun _ ↦ m`, the identification `W ⊗[k] k ≃ₗ[k] W` carries the action of
`ρ ⊗ det ^ m` to the action of `ρ` rescaled by that one character, which cancels off the
eigen-relation. So tensoring with `det ^ m` **translates** the weights of an *arbitrary*
representation by the constant sequence `m` (`TauCeti.weightSpace_tprod_detPowerRep`), over a
commutative ring, with no separation of weights and no assumption that `ρ` is weight-decomposed.
The same holds on the left, through `k ⊗[k] W ≃ₗ[k] W` (`TauCeti.weightSpace_detPowerRep_tprod`),
and that is the orientation in which the rational representations of `GL n` are written. What is
proved here is exactly that translation of weight spaces; it is the step that the classification
of the irreducible rational representations of `GL n` as `det`-twists of the polynomial ones runs
on, but that classification needs the highest-weight theory and is not proved here.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.tmul_mem_weightSpace_tprod`: a pure tensor of weight vectors has the sum of the two
  weights.
* `TauCeti.iSup_weightSpace_tprod_eq_top`: **the weight spaces of a tensor product span it**, as
  soon as the weight spaces of each factor span.
* `TauCeti.weightSpace_tprod`: **weights add.** The weight-`l` space of a tensor product is the
  sum, over the weights `a` of the first factor, of the products of the weight space of `a` with
  the weight space of `l - a` in the second, once the weight spaces of each factor span and
  distinct weights give distinct characters.
* `TauCeti.isInternal_weightSpace_tprod`: **a tensor product of weight-decomposed representations
  is weight-decomposed**, once distinct weights give distinct characters.
* `TauCeti.weightSpace_tprod_detPowerRep` and `TauCeti.weightSpace_detPowerRep_tprod`: **tensoring
  with `det ^ m` translates weights by the constant sequence `m`**, for an arbitrary
  representation, on either side, the translation being read through `W ⊗[k] k ≃ₗ[k] W` and
  `k ⊗[k] W ≃ₗ[k] W`.

## Implementation notes

The sum defining the weight-`l` space is indexed by a single weight `a`, the weight of the first
factor, with `l - a` the weight of the second; indexing instead by the pairs `(a, b)` with
`a + b = l` would carry a subtype through every rewrite for no gain.

The products of weight spaces are written with `Submodule.map₂ (TensorProduct.mk k W W')` rather
than with a tensor product of submodules: `Submodule.map₂` is the image of the pure tensors, which
is what the statements need, and it comes with the distributivity over suprema that the spanning
proof runs on.

The determinant twists are instead stated as a `Submodule.comap` along `W ⊗[k] k ≃ₗ[k] W` and
`k ⊗[k] W ≃ₗ[k] W`, in that one form only: `Submodule.mem_comap` then reads membership in the
twisted weight space off membership in the untwisted one, and the image form is
`Submodule.map_comap_eq_of_surjective` away. Both run on the same private lemma, which asks only
that some equivalence carry the action of the twisted representation to the action of `ρ`
rescaled by `det ^ m`; the two sides differ merely in that computation.

/-- **A pure tensor of weight vectors is a weight vector of the sum of the two weights**: a
diagonal matrix scales the two factors by the two characters, hence the tensor by their product,
and characters multiply when weights are added. -/

/-- The products of weight spaces of the two factors already exhaust the tensor product, once the
weight spaces of each factor span it. This is the shared engine of
`TauCeti.iSup_weightSpace_tprod_eq_top` and `TauCeti.weightSpace_tprod`, and is not part of the
API. -/

`TauCeti.tmul_mem_weightSpace_tprod` on pure tensors, spread over the whole tensor product. -/

/-! ## The determinant twist -/

/-- The normalization the determinant twist is read through: the character of a weight `l` is the
character of the constant weight `m` times the character of `l - m`. -/

/-- **An equivalence that rescales the action by `det ^ m` translates weights by the constant
sequence `m`.** A torus element acts on `det ^ m` by the character of the constant weight `m`, so
each of the two determinant twists below multiplies every character by that one; the factor is a
unit and cancels off the eigen-relation, which is why no separation of weights and no
decomposition of `ρ` is involved. -/

/-- **Tensoring with `det ^ m` on the right translates weights by the constant sequence `m`**:
read through `W ⊗[k] k ≃ₗ[k] W`, the weight-`l` space of `ρ ⊗ det ^ m` is the weight-`(l - m)`
space of `ρ`. This holds for every representation `ρ` over every commutative ring, since `det ^ m`
is the one-dimensional representation on which the torus acts by the character of the constant
weight `m`. Nothing beyond this translation of weight spaces is claimed: it is the computation
underlying the classification of the irreducible rational representations of `GL n` as
`det`-twists of the polynomial ones, which is not proved here. -/

/-! ## Weights add

Here the coefficients must separate weights, in the sense that `l ↦ weightChar k l` is injective;
`TauCeti.weightChar_injective` supplies that over an infinite field. -/

Only the inclusion `≥` is a computation; the inclusion `≤` says that a weight vector of the tensor
product has no component outside those products, and comes from the independence of the weight
spaces, whence the separation hypothesis. -/
