# Graph relabelling and skew-zigzag cohomology classes

The first cohomology class classifying a skew-zigzag parameter is natural under graph
isomorphisms and under a change of coefficient group. Thus changing vertex labels transports the
class by the induced isomorphism of graph cohomology, and a monoid homomorphism `k → l` carries
the class of a parameter to the class of its image under the induced change of coefficients
`H¹(G, kˣ) → H¹(G, lˣ)`.

The change of coefficients on cohomology is injective as soon as the induced map on units is, so
two parameters whose images under a monoid homomorphism have the same cohomology class were
already gauge equivalent, and, for a graph with a finite vertex set over a commutative ring, their
relation quotients were already isomorphic by an algebra isomorphism fixing every vertex
idempotent. The map on units is the hypothesis under which this is true, and no statement of
injectivity is made without it: the coefficient groups of the cohomology are the unit groups of the
coefficient monoids.

The parameter classification follows C. Couture, *Skew-Zigzag Algebras*, Section 4. The
cohomology transport uses the graph cohomology construction in
`TauCeti.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph.Cohomology.Basic`, and the change of coefficients in
`TauCeti.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph.Cohomology.Map`.
