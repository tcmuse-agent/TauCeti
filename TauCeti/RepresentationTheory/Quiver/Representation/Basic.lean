# Representations of a quiver

A representation of a quiver over a field assigns a vector space to every vertex and a linear map
to every arrow, compatibly with path composition. This is precisely a functor from Mathlib's free
path category to its category of modules.

This file introduces the standard abbreviation, finite biproducts of representations, and the fact
that the trivial path acts as the identity. It also names the vertex spaces as a family
`TauCeti.QuiverRep.vertexSpace` indexed by the vertices, with `TauCeti.QuiverRep.mapₗ` the
structure maps between them; that is what a construction indexed by the vertices — a direct sum, a
product — needs, since instance search does not see the objects of `CategoryTheory.Paths Q` as
vertices when it is asked for a *family* of instances over `Q` (see the implementation notes). The
equivalence with modules over the path algebra is `TauCeti.quiverRepEquivalence`, built in
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Representation.AsModule`.

## Implementation notes

A representation is a functor out of `CategoryTheory.Paths Q`, whose objects are vertices only
after unfolding the semireducible `CategoryTheory.Paths`. Instance search does not see through
that when it is asked for the *family* `∀ v : Q, AddCommMonoid (M.obj v)`, although it succeeds at
each individual vertex; naming the family as `TauCeti.QuiverRep.vertexSpace` and giving it its two
instances by `inferInstanceAs` is what makes such a family usable.

/-- **The trivial path acts as the identity.** In the free path category `Quiver.Path.nil` is the
identity morphism, so a representation carries it to the identity map. Stated separately because
`Quiver.Path.nil` is what appears when a path is taken apart, while `CategoryTheory.Functor.map_id`
is phrased in terms of `𝟙`: the two agree only by unfolding the semireducible
`CategoryTheory.Paths`, so `simp only [Functor.map_id]` makes no progress on a goal about
`Quiver.Path.nil`, and `simp` cannot compute the action of the trivial path without this lemma.
Mathlib states the same restatement for
functors of the form `CategoryTheory.Paths.lift φ`, as `CategoryTheory.Paths.lift_nil`; that lemma
does not apply to a general representation. -/
