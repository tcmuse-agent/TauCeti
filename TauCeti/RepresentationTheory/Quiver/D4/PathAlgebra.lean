# The path algebra of the `D₄` quiver

The `D₄` quiver has seven paths: the four trivial ones and the three arrows. So its path algebra
is seven-dimensional. Finite-dimensionality needs nothing specific to this quiver: it is acyclic,
so `TauCeti.finiteDimensional_pathAlgebra_of_isAcyclic` applies to it as it stands, via
`TauCeti.Quiver.D4.isAcyclic`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Quiver.D4.card_totalPath` and `TauCeti.Quiver.D4.finrank_pathAlgebra`: there are seven
  paths, so the path algebra is seven-dimensional.

## References

This file supplies the path algebra of the “`D₄` quiver” worked example of
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/QuiverRepresentations/README.md`. See Derksen--Weyman, *An
Introduction to Quiver Representations*, and Assem--Simson--Skowroński, *Elements of the
