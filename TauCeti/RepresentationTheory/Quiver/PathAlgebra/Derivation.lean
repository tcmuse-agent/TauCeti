# Graded derivations of a path algebra, freely determined by the arrows

Give every arrow `e` of a finite quiver `Q` an integer degree `wt e`. The path algebra `kQ` is then
`ℤ`-graded by `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.gradeBy k wt`, and a *degree `+1` graded derivation* of `kQ` is a
`k`-linear endomorphism `d` obeying the signed Leibniz rule

```text
d (x * y) = d x * y + (-1) ^ p • (x * d y)
```

for a left factor `x` homogeneous of degree `p`.

Such a derivation is free on the arrows. An assignment `f` sending an arrow `e : a ⟶ b` into the
corner `e_b (kQ) e_a` extends to the graded derivation `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.liftDerivation`, which
kills every vertex idempotent and takes the value `f e` on `e`, and it is the only one. Its value on
a path is read off from the recursion

```text
d (e ⬝ p) = f e ⬝ p + (-1) ^ (wt e) • (e ⬝ d p),
```

which the later-factor-first multiplication of Tau Ceti turns into an induction along `cons`.

The derivation is graded for *every* arrow weight at once: if a second weight `g`, valued in any
additive commutative monoid, gives `f e` the degree `g e + δ` for one fixed shift `δ`, then `d`
raises the `g`-degree by `δ`. Taking `g = wt` and `δ = 1` is the cohomological statement, and a
second weight with `δ = 0` is the Adams grading of a differential graded path algebra.

Finally, `d ∘ d` is again a derivation, an unsigned one, so it vanishes as soon as it vanishes on
the arrows; together with the two previous paragraphs this packages `d` as the differential of a
differential graded algebra.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.liftDerivation`: the graded derivation of `kQ` extending an assignment `f` of
  a corner element to each arrow.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.liftDerivation_ofArrow`: the derivation extends the assignment.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.liftDerivation_mul`: **the graded Leibniz rule**.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.liftDerivation_unique`: **a graded derivation is determined by its values on
  the arrows** and its vanishing on the vertex idempotents.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.liftDerivation_mem_gradeBy`: the derivation shifts the grading by an
  arbitrary arrow weight by a fixed amount, provided the assignment does.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.liftDerivation_sq_zero`: the square of the derivation vanishes as soon
  as it vanishes on the arrows.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.isDGAlgebra_liftDerivation`: **the resulting differential graded algebra**.
