# Path algebras of quivers

The path algebra `kQ` of a quiver `Q` over a semiring `k` is the free `k`-module on the paths of
`Q`, with the product of two paths their concatenation when they are composable and `0` otherwise.

Paths are concatenated in the *later factor first* order: for `p : Path a b` and `q : Path c a`,
the product of the corresponding basis elements is the basis element of `q.comp p : Path c b`.
With this convention an arrow `α : i ⟶ j` satisfies `eⱼ * α = α = α * eᵢ` for the vertex
idempotents `e`, so left multiplication by `α` carries the `i`-component of a left module to its
`j`-component: representations of `Q` are left `kQ`-modules.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath Q`: the total space `Σ a b, Path a b` of the paths of `Q`, the index
  type of the path basis.
* `TauCeti.Quiver.TotalPath.mul?`: concatenation of two indexed paths, `none` when they are not
  composable.
* `TauCeti.pathAlgebra k Q`: the path algebra, with `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.single` its basis
  elements. For any quiver it is a non-unital semiring or ring, associative or not, whenever `k`
  is, with scalars from `k` passing through products (on both sides when `k` is commutative), and
  it carries `Semiring`, `Ring` and `Algebra k` structures once the vertex type is `Finite`,
  finiteness being what makes the unit `1 = ∑ᵥ eᵥ` exist.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.vertexIdempotent`: the idempotent `eᵥ` given by the trivial path at `v`.
* `TauCeti.pathAlgebraBasis`: the paths of `Q` as a `k`-basis of `kQ`.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.liftAlgHom`: **the universal property of the path algebra**, extending an
  assignment of elements of a `k`-algebra to the basis paths to an algebra homomorphism out of
  `kQ`, the only one doing so by `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.liftAlgHom_unique`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.single_mul_single`: the defining product of two basis paths.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.one_def`: the vertex idempotents sum to `1`; they are
  orthogonal by `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.vertexIdempotent_mul_vertexIdempotent_of_ne`, idempotent by
  `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.vertexIdempotent_mul_self` and nonzero by
  `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.vertexIdempotent_ne_zero`. The first three are bundled as
  `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.completeOrthogonalIdempotents_vertexIdempotent`.
* `TauCeti.module_finite_pathAlgebra` and `TauCeti.finrank_pathAlgebra`: `kQ` is a free module of
  rank the number of paths of `Q`, with `TauCeti.pathAlgebraBasis_repr_single` reading off the
  coordinates of a basis path and `TauCeti.linearIndependent_ofPath` recording that any
  subfamily of the path basis stays linearly independent. Over a nonzero `k` the finiteness is an
  equivalence, `TauCeti.module_finite_pathAlgebra_iff`; the specialization to a finite acyclic
  quiver, whose paths are finite, is `TauCeti.finiteDimensional_pathAlgebra_of_isAcyclic` in
  `TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Acyclic.PathAlgebra`.
* `TauCeti.vertexIdempotent_mul_mul_vertexIdempotent`: when the trivial path is the only path from
  `v` to itself, `eᵥ f eᵥ` is the coefficient of `f` on that path, times `eᵥ`, so the corner
  `eᵥ kQ eᵥ` is a copy of `k`. This is what makes the trivial paths visible to a two-sided ideal.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.adjoin_vertexIdempotents_union_arrows`: the vertex idempotents and arrows
  generate the path algebra.

## Implementation notes

`pathAlgebra k Q` is a semireducible type synonym for `Quiver.TotalPath Q →₀ k`, following the
pattern of `MonoidAlgebra`: were it reducible, instance search would unfold it and pick up the
*pointwise* multiplication of `Finsupp`. The multiplication is therefore introduced as an
operation `mul'` on `Quiver.TotalPath Q →₀ k` (with `singleOption` naming the product of two basis
paths, which is a basis path or `0`), where the `Finsupp` API applies without friction; the ring
axioms are proved there and transferred definitionally.

That whole layer is private. The exposed `Mul` instance spells out the same operation because it
cannot mention a private declaration; `mul_def` records their definitional agreement. The ring
axioms reach the structure instances through a `by exact` for the same reason. `pathAlgebra` is the
only definition whose body is `@[expose]`d, because the transported instances unfold it; every other
definition here is opaque downstream, which sees the path algebra through its algebraic structure
and the lemmas below
(`ofPath_eq_single` and `vertexIdempotent_eq_single` for the basis elements, `single_mul_single`
and the `mul?` lemmas for products) rather than through the `Finsupp` representation.

Since `Finset.univ` is data, the unit is the sum of the vertex idempotents over a `Fintype`
structure chosen internally by `Fintype.ofFinite`; the unital instances therefore ask only for
`[Finite Q]`, and `one_def` identifies `1` with the sum over *any* `Fintype Q` a caller supplies.
