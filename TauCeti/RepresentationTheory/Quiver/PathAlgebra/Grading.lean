# Gradings of a path algebra by arrow weights

The path algebra `kQ` is free on the paths of `Q`. Give every arrow `e` a weight `wt e` in an
additive monoid `M`, and give a path the sum `Quiver.Path.addWeight wt` of the weights of its
arrows. Concatenating paths adds their weights, so the span `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.gradeBy k wt m` of
the paths of weight `m` makes `kQ` an `M`-graded `k`-algebra once `M` is commutative. This file
constructs that grading in the internal sense: the graded pieces are submodules of `kQ` itself and
the decomposition compares them with `kQ`, rather than with a separate graded copy of it.

The **path-length grading** `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.grade k Q` is the case of the constant weight
`1 : ℕ`. Degree `0` is the span of the vertex idempotents and degree `1` is the span of the
arrows. Each piece is free on the paths of that length, and each sits inside the corresponding step
`TauCeti.pathSpan k Q n` of the length filtration of
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Radical`, which spans the paths of length *at least* `n`.

Other weights give the underlying gradings of DG path algebras. The (uncompleted) Ginzburg DG
algebra has as underlying graded algebra the path algebra of a quiver whose added loops sit in a
negative cohomological degree, and its Adams grading is a second, independent weight on the same
arrows (Etgü--Lekili; Keller); the standard construction further completes this graded path
algebra and equips it with a differential, neither of which is part of `gradeBy`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.gradeBy`: the degree-`m` piece of the grading by an arrow weight, the span
  of the paths of weight `m`.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.gradeByBasis`: the paths of weight `m` as a `k`-basis of that piece.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.decomposeAlgHom`: the algebra homomorphism to the direct sum decomposing
  elements by weight, which is `DirectSum.decompose` for the grading below.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.grade`: the degree-`n` piece of the path-length grading, the span of the
  paths of length `n`.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.gradeBasis`: the paths of length `n` as a `k`-basis of that piece.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.gradeBy.gradedAlgebra`: **the grading by an arrow weight**, the
  `GradedAlgebra` instance on `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.gradeBy`. Its multiplicative half,
  `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.gradeBy_mul_gradeBy_le`, is the statement that multiplication adds
  weights, and `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.isInternal_gradeBy` is the comparison of the direct sum of the
  pieces with `kQ` itself.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.mem_gradeBy_iff`: an element is homogeneous of weight `m` exactly when its
  path coordinates are supported on the paths of weight `m`.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.ofArrow_mem_gradeBy`: an arrow is homogeneous of its own weight, and
  `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.ofArrow_mem_gradeBy_iff` and
  `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.vertexIdempotent_mem_gradeBy_iff` read off the degree of an arrow and of a
  vertex idempotent.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.gradedAlgebra`: **the path-length grading**, the `GradedAlgebra` instance
  on `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.grade`, with `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.grade_mul_grade_le` and
  `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.isInternal_grade` its two halves.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.grade_zero_eq_span_range_vertexIdempotent` and
  `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.grade_one_eq_span_range_ofArrow`: the vertex idempotents span degree `0`
  and the arrows span degree `1`.
* `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.grade_le_pathSpan`: the degree-`n` piece lies in the `n`-th step of the
  length filtration.

## Implementation notes

The grading is constructed from `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.decomposeAlgHom`, built from the universal
property `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.liftAlgHom` in the same way as
`AddMonoidAlgebra.gradeBy.gradedAlgebra` is built from the universal property of an additive monoid
algebra: an assignment of a homogeneous summand to each basis path is an algebra map to the direct
sum as soon as it respects the three defining products of `kQ`. It is what
`GradedAlgebra.ofAlgHom` installs as `DirectSum.decompose`; the two maps are definitionally equal.
As for `AddMonoidAlgebra.grade` and `AddMonoidAlgebra.gradeBy`, the length grading is the weight
grading at one particular weight, so its graded-algebra structure is that of
`TauCeti.PathAlgebra.gradeBy`.

The unit of `kQ` is the sum of the vertex idempotents, which exists only for a finite vertex type,
so the graded *pieces* are defined for every quiver while the grading itself asks for `[Finite Q]`.
