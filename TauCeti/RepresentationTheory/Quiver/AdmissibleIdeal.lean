# Admissible ideals and bound quiver algebras

A two-sided ideal `I` of a path algebra `kQ` is *admissible* when it is squeezed between a power
of the arrow ideal `R` and its square, `R ^ N ≤ I ≤ R ^ 2`. The two bounds say complementary
things about the relations `I` imposes. The upper bound `I ≤ R ^ 2` says that every relation is a
combination of paths of length at least two: a relation involving a vertex idempotent or a single
arrow would change the quiver data itself — identifying or collapsing vertices or arrows — rather
than impose a relation on the paths of `Q`. The lower bound `R ^ N ≤ I` says that all long enough
paths are killed, which is what cuts the quotient down to finite dimension.

The quotient `kQ ⧸ I` by an admissible ideal is a *bound quiver algebra*, and the two main results
here are its two basic properties: it is **finite-dimensional** whenever the quiver has finitely
many vertices and arrows, even when `kQ` itself is not, and every element of the arrow ideal
becomes **nilpotent** in it.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsAdmissibleIdeal`: the predicate `R ^ N ≤ I ≤ R ^ 2` on a two-sided ideal of a path
  algebra, for the arrow ideal `R = TauCeti.arrowIdeal k Q` and some `N`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsAdmissibleIdeal.finiteDimensional_quotient`: **a bound quiver algebra is
  finite-dimensional**, over a quiver with finitely many vertices and finitely many arrows. No
  acyclicity is needed, and the one-loop quiver shows that this is a genuine gain: its path
  algebra `k[X]` is infinite-dimensional (`TauCeti.not_finiteDimensional_pathAlgebra_oneLoop`)
  while the quotients `k[X] ⧸ (Xⁿ)` by the admissible ideals of
  `TauCeti.isAdmissibleIdeal_arrowIdeal_pow` are not.
* `TauCeti.IsAdmissibleIdeal.isNilpotent_mk_of_mem_arrowIdeal`: the image of an element of
  the arrow ideal in a bound quiver algebra is nilpotent.
* `TauCeti.IsAdmissibleIdeal.ofPath_notMem_of_length_lt_two`, together with
  `TauCeti.IsAdmissibleIdeal.vertexIdempotent_notMem` and
  `TauCeti.IsAdmissibleIdeal.ofArrow_notMem`: an admissible ideal contains no vertex idempotent and
  no arrow, so the quiver survives the passage to the quotient. In particular the quotient is
  nonzero, `TauCeti.IsAdmissibleIdeal.nontrivial_quotient`. More is true and is
  `TauCeti.IsAdmissibleIdeal.linearIndependent_mk_ofPath_of_length_lt_two`: the vertices and the
  arrows stay *linearly independent* in the quotient, so the quotient map is injective on their
  span.
* `TauCeti.isAdmissibleIdeal_iff`: admissibility checked entirely on the path basis.
* `TauCeti.isAdmissibleIdeal_arrowIdeal_pow`: the powers `R ^ n` with `2 ≤ n` are admissible, and
  `TauCeti.isAdmissibleIdeal_bot_of_isAcyclic`: over a finite acyclic quiver the zero ideal is
  admissible, so `kQ` is itself a bound quiver algebra, with no relations.

## Implementation notes

The exponent `N` of the lower bound is existentially quantified in the definition rather than
carried as data: no result below depends on a particular choice, and quantifying it makes
`TauCeti.isAdmissibleIdeal_arrowIdeal_pow` and `TauCeti.isAdmissibleIdeal_bot_of_isAcyclic` the
statements they should be. The usual textbook phrasing adds `2 ≤ N`, which is redundant: `R ^ N`
decreases in `N`, so `R ^ N ≤ I` for some `N` gives it for every larger one.

`Ideal R` means *left* ideal in Mathlib, two-sidedness being the separate typeclass
`Ideal.IsTwoSided` — which `TauCeti.arrowIdeal` carries. Admissibility is a notion about
*two-sided* ideals: it is the quotient *algebra* `kQ ⧸ I` that it exists to describe, and the two
inclusions `R ^ N ≤ I ≤ R ^ 2` alone do not force `I` to be two-sided. `TauCeti.IsAdmissibleIdeal`
therefore takes `[I.IsTwoSided]` as an argument of the predicate itself, so that the ideals it
speaks of are exactly the admissible ones, and every consequence — in particular those about the
quotient, where `Ideal.Quotient` asks for the same instance — is available from the predicate
alone. For the ideals of `TauCeti.isAdmissibleIdeal_arrowIdeal_pow` and
`TauCeti.isAdmissibleIdeal_bot_of_isAcyclic` the instance is found by synthesis.

Finite dimensionality is proved by spanning: the images of the paths of length less than `N` span
the quotient, because every longer path already lies in `I`, and there are finitely many of them
(`TauCeti.Quiver.finite_setOf_length_lt`). This is where the finiteness of the *arrow* types
enters — the rest of the file needs only finitely many vertices, that being what makes `kQ`
unital.
