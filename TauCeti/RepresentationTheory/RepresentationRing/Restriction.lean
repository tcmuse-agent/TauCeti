# Restriction is a homomorphism of representation rings

For a monoid homomorphism `φ : G →* H` over a field `k`, restricting a finite-dimensional
representation of `H` along `φ` is Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.Action.res (FGModuleCat k) φ`, under
the definitional identification `FDRep k G = Action (FGModuleCat k) G`. This file passes that
functor to the representation rings of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/RepresentationRing/Basic.lean`:

`TauCeti.repRingRes k φ : R(H) →+* R(G)`.

It is a homomorphism of **rings**, not merely of additive groups, and for a strong reason:
restriction does not merely commute with the tensor product up to a comparison isomorphism, it
preserves it *on the nose*. The action of `H` on `X ⊗ Y` is `g ↦ X.ρ g ⊗ₘ Y.ρ g`, so precomposing
with `φ` is the same as precomposing in each factor, and likewise the restriction of the trivial
one-dimensional representation is the trivial one-dimensional representation. That is the content
of the monoidal structure on `Action.res` recorded in
`TauCeti/CategoryTheory/Action/Monoidal.lean`, whose unit and tensorator are identities, and it is
what `TauCeti.SplitK0.mapRingHom` consumes here.

On characters everything is as expected: the character of a restriction is the character
precomposed with `φ` (`TauCeti.repRingCharacter_repRingRes`), so the square formed by the two
character homomorphisms and the two restrictions commutes. Read elementwise, that square is the
statement that a virtual character of `H` pulls back to a virtual character of `G`, which is
`TauCeti.comp_mem_virtualCharacters`, proved directly on the class functions.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.repRingRes`: restriction along a monoid homomorphism, as a ring homomorphism of
  representation rings.
* `TauCeti.repRingResEquiv`: restriction along an isomorphism of monoids, as a ring isomorphism.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.repRingRes_of`: restriction sends the class of a representation to the class of its
  restriction. For a subgroup `S ≤ G`, restriction along `S.subtype` is restriction to `S`.
* `TauCeti.repRingRes_id` and `TauCeti.repRingRes_comp`: restriction is functorial, contravariantly
  in the homomorphism.
* `TauCeti.repRingCharacter_repRingRes` and `TauCeti.repRingCharacter_repRingRes_apply`: the
  character of a restricted virtual representation is the character precomposed with `φ`.

## Implementation notes

The three monoids are left in three independent universes: nothing here needs them to agree, and
the subgroup case `S.subtype : S →* G` lands in the same universe as `G` anyway.

Induction in the other direction is *not* a ring homomorphism -- it is a homomorphism of
`R(G)`-modules, by the projection formula `TauCeti.indProjection` -- and is not built here.

It is Mathlib's restriction functor `CategoryTheory.Action.res` fed to
`TauCeti.SplitK0.mapRingHom`, and it is multiplicative because that functor is monoidal
