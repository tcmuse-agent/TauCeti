# A projective representation is a linear representation of the central extension of its factor set

A projective representation `ρ : G → (V ≃ₗ[k] V)` with factor set `α` is multiplicative only up to
the scalars `α`, so it is not a homomorphism. Enlarging `G` by those scalars repairs this: the
central extension `1 → kˣ → E_α → G → 1` built from `α` in
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/GroupExtension/Of/FactorSet.lean` carries a genuine homomorphism

`E_α → (V ≃ₗ[k] V)`, `⟨a, g⟩ ↦ a • ρ g`,

the **linearization** of `ρ`. This file builds it, and shows that nothing is lost: the projective
representation is recovered by restricting the linearization along the canonical section
`g ↦ ⟨1, g⟩`, and the two constructions are mutually inverse. The linear representations of `E_α`
that arise this way are exactly those under which the central copy of `kˣ` acts by its own scalars,
so `TauCeti.isProjectiveRepEquivExtensionHom` is a bijection between the projective representations
of `G` with factor set `α` and the linear representations of `E_α` with that property.

The curried/uncurried bookkeeping bridges come first, because the two halves of the theory
spell a factor set differently. `TauCeti.FactorSet` is the uncurried, bundled `G × G → M`
of a general `G`-module `M`,
which is what the group extension is built from, while `TauCeti.IsFactorSet` is a curried
`Prop`-valued class on `G → G → kˣ`, which is what a projective representation carries. The two
agree when `G` acts **trivially** on `kˣ`, the case in which the extension is central
(`TauCeti.FactorSet.inl_range_le_center`), and `TauCeti.FactorSet.isFactorSet_curry` and
`TauCeti.IsFactorSet.toFactorSet` translate in the two directions. Triviality of the action is
carried as an explicit hypothesis `∀ (g : G) (a : kˣ), g • a = a` rather than as a chosen instance,
matching `TauCeti.FactorSet.inl_range_le_center`: the *type* `TauCeti.FactorSet G kˣ` already
depends on an ambient `MulDistribMulAction G kˣ`, so leaving that action free lets a factor set for
any action be fed to the statements, and only the results that genuinely need centrality pay for
it. A projective representation itself carries no action, so the closing existence statement
supplies the trivial one, `TauCeti.trivialMulDistribMulAction`, and asks for nothing of its caller.

For a factor set whose values have exponent dividing `n`,
`TauCeti.IsFactorSet.toRootsOfUnityFactorSet` also restricts the values to `rootsOfUnity n k`.
This lets finite lifting extensions use roots of unity as their kernel coefficients.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.trivialMulDistribMulAction`: the trivial action, the one a projective representation's
  own factor set is bundled over, since a projective representation carries no action.
* `TauCeti.IsFactorSet.toFactorSet`: a normalized curried factor set, bundled as a
  `TauCeti.FactorSet` for a trivial action, so that its central extension is available.
* `TauCeti.IsFactorSet.toRootsOfUnityFactorSet`: a factor set with values of exponent dividing
  `n`, bundled with coefficients in the `n`-th roots of unity for finite lifting extensions.
* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveRep.linearization`: the homomorphism `E_α → (V ≃ₗ[k] V)` attached to a
  projective representation with factor set `α`, with
  `TauCeti.IsProjectiveRep.linearizationRepresentation` its packaging as a
  `Representation k E_α V`.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.restrictCanonicalSection`: the restriction of a `Representation k E_α V` along
  the canonical section, as linear automorphisms of `V`, the form in which it is a projective
  representation.
* `TauCeti.isProjectiveRepEquivExtensionHom`: the resulting bijection.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.FactorSet.isFactorSet_curry`: for a trivial action a `TauCeti.FactorSet` valued in `kˣ`
  is a normalized factor set in the curried sense of `TauCeti.IsFactorSet`.
* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveRep.linearization_mk_one`: restricting the linearization along the canonical
  section returns the projective representation, and
  `TauCeti.IsProjectiveRep.linearization_inl`: the central `kˣ` acts by its own scalars.
* `TauCeti.isProjectiveRep_comp_canonicalSection`: conversely, restricting along the canonical
  section any linear representation of `E_α` under which `kˣ` acts by scalars gives a projective
  representation with factor set `α`, and
  `TauCeti.isProjectiveRep_of_representation_canonicalSection`: the same for a linear representation
  presented as an ordinary `Representation k E_α V`, whose scalar condition is read off the
  linearization by `TauCeti.IsProjectiveRep.linearizationRepresentation_inl`, with
  `TauCeti.isProjectiveRep_restrictCanonicalSection` its instance at the canonical restriction.
* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveRep.forall_linearization_mem_iff`: the linearization and the projective
  representation have the same invariant submodules, which is why irreducibility transfers between
  them.
* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveRep.exists_factorSet_linearization`: **every projective representation of
  `G` is a linear representation of a central extension of `G` by `kˣ`**, for the extension built
  from the factor set the projective representation carries.

## Factor sets, curried and uncurried

The extension is built from a bundled, uncurried factor set while a projective representation
carries a curried one; for the trivial action, defined first, the two notions agree.

tautological action of `MulAut M` with the trivial homomorphism. It is the action for which the
extension built from a factor set is central, so it is the one a projective representation's factor
set is bundled over in `TauCeti.IsProjectiveRep.exists_factorSet_linearization`. It is reducible and
deliberately not an instance, since the results below are stated for an arbitrary action; it is only
used to supply one where the ambient theory has none. -/

## The linearization of a projective representation

Multiplying by the scalar recorded in the `kˣ`-component of the extension repairs the failure of
`ρ` to be multiplicative, because that failure is exactly the factor set the extension is twisted
