# Projective representations and their factor sets

A **projective representation** of a monoid `G` on a `k`-module `V` is a normalized lift
`ρ : G → (V ≃ₗ[k] V)` of a homomorphism into the projective linear group: it sends `1` to the
identity and is multiplicative up to a scalar,

`ρ g₁ (ρ g₂ x) = α g₁ g₂ • ρ (g₁ * g₂) x`

for a normalized factor set `α : G → G → kˣ`, the **factor set** of `ρ`. Both the invertibility of
each `ρ g` and the normalization `ρ 1 = 1` are load-bearing: the constant zero family satisfies the
displayed relation for every `α`, so without them nothing below is true.

Working with a normalized lift rather than with a homomorphism `G → PGL(V)` keeps the theory
basis-free and puts the factor set in the statement, where the rest of the theory needs it.

That `α` is a factor set is rarely something to check by hand: as soon as `kˣ` acts faithfully on
`V` it is *determined* by `ρ`, and `TauCeti.IsProjectiveRep.of_map_one_mul_apply` derives its
normalization and its multiplicative `2`-cocycle identity from associativity of composition, so
there only the two conditions on `ρ` remain. The main results then identify projective
representations with factor set `α` with modules over the twisted monoid algebra `k_α[G]` of
`TauCeti.twistedMonoidAlgebra`: a module structure on `V` is an algebra map
`k_α[G] →ₐ[k] Module.End k V`, and `TauCeti.isProjectiveRepEquivAlgHom` is the bijection between
those and the projective representations with factor set `α`. Under it the twisted monoid algebra
itself becomes the **twisted regular representation**, which realizes every factor set.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveRep ρ α`: `ρ` is a projective representation with factor set `α`.
* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveRep.toAlgHom`: the algebra map `k_α[G] →ₐ[k] Module.End k V` a projective
  representation with factor set `α` determines, that is, the `k_α[G]`-module structure on `V`.
* `TauCeti.projectiveRepOfAlgHom`: the projective representation attached to an algebra map out of
  `k_α[G]`, inverse to the previous construction.
* `TauCeti.isProjectiveRepEquivAlgHom`: the resulting bijection.
* `TauCeti.twistedRegularRep`: the twisted regular representation of `G` on `G →₀ k`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveRep.of_map_one_mul_apply`: when `kˣ` acts faithfully on `V` the factor-set
  axioms are automatic, and `TauCeti.IsProjectiveRep.factorSet_eq`: there the factor set is
  determined by the lift.
* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveRep.rescale`: rescaling the lift by `c : G → kˣ` multiplies the factor set by
  the coboundary of `c`. A fixed lift determines its factor set outright; it is the cohomology
  class that is unchanged by normalized rescaling, hence an invariant of the underlying projective
  action rather than of the lift.
* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveRep.toMonoidHom` and `TauCeti.IsProjectiveRep.of_monoidHom`: the projective
  representations with trivial factor set are exactly the linear representations.
* `TauCeti.exists_isProjectiveRep`: every normalized factor set is the factor set of a projective
  representation.

it is curried here to match `TauCeti.IsFactorSet` and the twisted monoid algebra that consume it.

## For a faithful action of the units the factor-set axioms are automatic

When `kˣ` acts faithfully on `V` the scalars in the defining relation are determined by the lift,
and associativity of composition forces the cocycle identity on them. So there a normalized lift
that is multiplicative up to `α` is already a projective representation, and its factor set is
unique. Faithfulness is exactly what lets a scalar be read off from its action, and only the
scalars in `kˣ` are ever compared, so `[FaithfulSMul kˣ V]` is what is asked for; `k` acting
faithfully — as it does on a nonzero torsion-free module, a nonzero vector space in particular —
supplies it.
