# The invariant form on a permutation representation

A permutation representation `k[X]` of a group `G` on a `G`-set `X` carries a canonical bilinear
form, the one for which the standard basis `single x 1` is orthonormal: the pairing of `v` and `w`
is the sum of `v x * w x` over the (finite) support of `v`.  Because the action of a group element
permutes the standard basis, this **permutation form** is invariant, and the orthogonal complement
of an invariant submodule is again invariant.

Over a linearly ordered commutative semiring with `ExistsAddOfLE` the form is positive definite,
so its restriction to *any* submodule is nondegenerate. The `ExistsAddOfLE` assumption says that
`a ≤ b` implies `b = a + c` for some `c`; it holds for ordered rings and for `ℕ`. Over an ordered
field, when `X` is finite, the orthogonal complement of a subrepresentation is a genuine
complement.  This exhibits a canonical invariant complement of a subrepresentation of a
permutation representation: one that needs no averaging operator and no hypothesis on `G`, and
whose orthogonality relation is a tool in its own right.  An ordered field has characteristic zero,
so the complementation statements say nothing about positive characteristic; what they drop
relative to Maschke's theorem is finiteness of `G` and invertibility of `|G|`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.permutationForm`: the bilinear form on `k[X]` making the standard basis orthonormal.
* `TauCeti.orthogonalSubrepresentation`: the orthogonal complement of a subrepresentation of a
  permutation representation, as a subrepresentation.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.permutationForm_single_single`: the standard basis is orthonormal.
* `TauCeti.permutationForm_isSymm` and `TauCeti.permutationForm_nondegenerate`: the form is
  symmetric and nondegenerate over any commutative semiring.
* `TauCeti.permutationForm_ofMulAction_invariant`: the action of a group element preserves the
  form, and `TauCeti.permutationForm_ofMulAction_left` moves that action across the form by
  inverting it.
* `TauCeti.orthogonal_mem_invtSubmodule`: the orthogonal complement of an invariant submodule of a
  permutation representation is invariant.
* `TauCeti.permutationForm_self_pos` and `TauCeti.permutationForm_restrict_nondegenerate`: over a
  linearly ordered commutative semiring with `ExistsAddOfLE` the form is positive definite, hence
  nondegenerate on every submodule.
* `TauCeti.isCompl_orthogonalSubrepresentation`: over an ordered field, and for a finite `G`-set,
  a subrepresentation is complemented by its orthogonal complement.

## Implementation notes

The form is defined on `MonoidAlgebra k X` rather than on `X →₀ k` because that is the module
Mathlib's `Representation.ofMulAction` acts on.  Here `X` carries no multiplication and the
monoid-algebra product plays no role; only the free module on `X` and its standard basis do.  For a
finite `X` the form is the one with identity Gram matrix, which under the identification of `k[X]`
with `X → k` is Mathlib's `Matrix.toBilin' 1`; the definition below is stated with `Finsupp.sum` so
that it needs no finiteness and no `DecidableEq X`.

Positive definiteness, not invertibility of `|G|`, is what drives the complementation statements,
which is why they ask for an ordered field rather than for a finite group. In particular nothing
below reproves Maschke's theorem: the content is that the complement can be taken orthogonal, so
that a submodule and its complement are separated by an explicit pairing.

The orthogonal-complement half of this file is the bilinear-form transcription of an existing
TauCeti development: `ofMulAction_mem_orthogonal`, `orthogonal_mem_invtSubmodule`,
`orthogonalSubrepresentation`, `toSubmodule_orthogonalSubrepresentation` and
`isCompl_orthogonalSubrepresentation` follow, statement for statement and proof for proof, their
namesakes in `TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Continuous.InvariantComplement`, with
`IsUnitary.inner_map_right` replaced by `permutationForm_ofMulAction_left` and
`Submodule.isCompl_orthogonal` by
`LinearMap.BilinForm.isCompl_orthogonal_of_restrict_nondegenerate`.  The two cannot be unified:
that file works over an inner-product space, which is unavailable over `ℚ`.
