# The power sums and the permutation characters of `Sₙ`

Let `ψ^ν` be the character of the Young permutation module `M^ν`, the permutation representation
of `Sₙ` on the `ν`-tabloids.  These characters are the coefficients of the power-sum product
`p_ρ` of a partition `ρ` of `n` in the monomial symmetric polynomials `m_ν`,

`p_ρ = ∑_{ν ⊢ n} ψ^ν(ρ) m_ν`,

where `ψ^ν(ρ)` is the value of `ψ^ν` at any permutation of cycle type `ρ`.  Equivalently, the
coefficient of `x^d` in `p_ρ`, when `d.degree = n`, is the number of tabloids fixed by such a
permutation, for the shape obtained by sorting the exponents of `x^d`.

The proof reads both sides as counts of invariant colourings.  A `ν`-tabloid is a colouring of
`Fin n` by the rows of `ν` (`TauCeti.quotientFiberSubgroupEquiv`, applied to the row map
`TauCeti.youngBlock ν`), and it is fixed by `π` exactly when the colouring is constant on the cycles
of `π`; on the other side, the coefficient of `x^d` in `p_ρ` counts the colourings constant on the
cycles of `π` with `d i` points of colour `i` (`TauCeti.coeff_psumPart_partition`).  Writing the
rows of `ν` as letters of the alphabet puts the two counts side by side at the sorted monomial of
`ν`, and the symmetry of `p_ρ` moves any other monomial of degree `n` there
(`TauCeti.coeff_eq_coeff_partWeight`).

Combined with Young's rule, `ψ^ν = ∑_λ K_{λν} χ^λ`, and the monomial expansion of the Schur
polynomials `s_λ = ∑_ν K_{λν} m_ν` (`TauCeti.schurPoly_eq_sum_kostkaNumber_smul_msymm`), this
expansion is Frobenius's formula `p_ρ = ∑_λ χ^λ(ρ) s_λ` for the irreducible characters.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.coeff_partWeight_psumPart_partition`: the coefficient of the power-sum product over the
  cycle type of `π` at the sorted monomial of `ν` counts the `ν`-tabloids fixed by `π`.
* `TauCeti.coeff_psumPart_eq_card_fixedPoints`: **the coefficient of `p_ρ` at any monomial of
  degree `n`** counts the tabloids fixed by a permutation of cycle type `ρ`, for the shape of the
  monomial.
* `TauCeti.psumPart_eq_sum_card_fixedPoints_smul_msymm`: **the monomial expansion of `p_ρ`**, with
  the fixed-tabloid counts as coefficients.
* `TauCeti.psumPart_eq_sum_character_smul_msymm`: the same expansion over `ℚ`, with the
  characters of the Young permutation modules as coefficients.
