# Real forms of a complex representation

A **real form** of a representation `ρ` of `G` on a complex vector space `V` is a real
representation `σ` on a real vector space `W` whose complexification is `ρ`: a `ℂ`-linear
isomorphism `ℂ ⊗[ℝ] W ≃ₗ[ℂ] V` intertwining `1 ⊗ σ g` with `ρ g`.  Only the values on the pure
tensors `1 ⊗ₜ w` are asked for, which is enough because those generate `ℂ ⊗[ℝ] W` over `ℂ`:
`Representation.isRealForm_iff_nonempty_equiv` upgrades the condition to an equivalence of
representations `(Representation.baseChange ℂ σ).Equiv ρ`, which is the statement that `ρ` *is* the
complexification of `σ`.  A representation is **realizable over `ℝ`** when it admits a real form.

`Representation.IsRealForm` allows any carrier for the real form, while
`Representation.IsRealizableOverReal` pins it to `Fin (finrank ℂ V) → ℝ`, so that the predicate
needs no type existential; nothing is lost by pinning it, because
`Representation.IsRealForm.isRealizableOverReal` transports a real form of a finite-dimensional
representation to the pinned carrier along a real basis (the carrier of the real form is then
finite-dimensional too, by `Representation.IsRealForm.finiteDimensional_iff`).  The pinned
predicate needs no finite-dimensionality hypothesis either: the pinned carrier is
finite-dimensional, so it already implies `FiniteDimensional ℂ V`
(`Representation.IsRealizableOverReal.finiteDimensional`).  For an infinite-dimensional `V` it is
therefore simply false, and `Representation.IsRealForm` is the notion to use there.

Everything here is for a representation of an arbitrary monoid: the real-form vocabulary and its
transports never invert a group element, and the passage to the Frobenius-Schur indicator that
consumes them -- `Representation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_one_of_isRealizableOverReal`, in
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.CharacterTable.FrobeniusSchur.RealForm` -- asks for a finite group
only where it sums over the group.

A real form is a statement about an auxiliary carrier `W`; the equivalent statement *inside* `V` is
a **real structure**, a conjugation `K` of `V` -- a conjugate-linear involution -- commuting with
the action.  Its real points `TauCeti.realPoints K` carry a real representation whose
complexification is `ρ` (`Representation.IsRealStructure.isRealForm`), and conversely a real form
transports the conjugation `c ⊗ₜ w ↦ conj c ⊗ₜ w` of `ℂ ⊗[ℝ] W` to `V`
(`Representation.IsRealForm.exists_isRealStructure`).  So the two notions agree
(`Representation.isRealizableOverReal_iff_exists_isRealStructure`).  This is the form in which
realizability is *produced*: the route to it for an irreducible representation with
Frobenius-Schur indicator `1` is to build the conjugation out of an invariant symmetric bilinear
form and an invariant Hermitian inner product, and a real form on a carrier is not something one
writes down directly.  That route is taken in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/InvariantForm/StructureMap.lean`, and read off as a criterion on the
indicator in `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/FrobeniusSchur/Realizability.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `Representation.IsRealForm`: `σ` is a real form of `ρ`.
* `Representation.IsRealizableOverReal`: `ρ` admits a real form on a carrier pinned by the
  dimension of `V`.
* `Representation.IsRealStructure`: `K` is a real structure on `ρ`, that is, a conjugation of `V`
  commuting with the action.
* `Representation.IsRealStructure.rep`: the real representation it induces on the real points.

## Main results

* `Representation.isRealForm_iff_nonempty_equiv`: a real form is exactly an equivalence of
  representations from the complexification of `σ` to `ρ`.
* `Representation.IsRealStructure.isRealForm`: **the real points of a real structure are a real
  form**, and `Representation.IsRealForm.exists_isRealStructure` is the converse.
* `Representation.IsRealStructure.isRealizableOverReal`: a real structure on a finite-dimensional
  `ρ` realizes it over `ℝ` in the pinned sense.
* `Representation.isRealizableOverReal_iff_exists_isRealStructure`: over a finite-dimensional `V`,
  realizability over `ℝ` is exactly the existence of a real structure.
* `Representation.IsRealStructure.finrank_realPoints`: the real points of a real structure have
  `ℝ`-dimension `finrank ℂ V`.
* `Representation.IsRealForm.char_eq`: the character of a representation with a real
  form is the character of that real form, in particular real-valued
  (`Representation.IsRealForm.conj_char`).
* `Representation.IsRealForm.exists_isInvariantForm_isSymm_ne_zero`: a real form transports a
  nonzero invariant symmetric real form to a nonzero invariant symmetric complex form.
* `Representation.IsRealForm.finiteDimensional_iff`: a real form is finite-dimensional exactly when
  the representation it is a form of is.
* `Representation.IsRealForm.isRealizableOverReal`: a real form of a finite-dimensional
  representation makes `ρ` realizable over `ℝ` in the pinned sense.
* `Representation.IsRealizableOverReal.finiteDimensional`: a representation realizable over `ℝ` is
  finite-dimensional.

/-- The intertwining condition on pure tensors upgrades to the whole complexification: an
isomorphism intertwining on `1 ⊗ₜ w` carries the base change of `σ g` to `ρ g`.  Both sides are
`ℂ`-linear, so it is enough to check them on the generators `a ⊗ₜ w`.  This is the content of
`Representation.isRealForm_iff_nonempty_equiv`, which is the public form of the statement. -/

(`Module.Finite.of_finite_tensorProduct_of_faithfullyFlat`).  Both directions are available with no
finiteness in the ambient context, so a consumer holding finiteness on either side gets it on the
other; comparing dimensions instead (`Representation.IsRealForm.finrank_eq`) would say nothing when
the common dimension is `0`. -/

/-! ### Realizability over the reals -/

variable (ρ) in
/-- **Realizability over `ℝ`**: `ρ` admits a real form on the carrier `Fin (finrank ℂ V) → ℝ`.
Pinning the carrier avoids a type existential; a real form on an arbitrary carrier is
`Representation.IsRealForm`, and every result about the indicator is proved from that more general
notion.

Pinning the carrier by the dimension costs nothing: the pinned carrier is finite-dimensional, so a
real form on it already forces `V` to be finite-dimensional
(`Representation.IsRealizableOverReal.finiteDimensional`), and conversely every real form on a
finite-dimensional carrier transports to the pinned one
(`Representation.IsRealForm.isRealizableOverReal`).  For an infinite-dimensional `V` the predicate
is therefore simply false -- `finrank ℂ V` is then `0` and the pinned carrier is the zero space --
and `Representation.IsRealForm` is the notion to use there. -/
def IsRealizableOverReal : Prop :=
  ∃ σ : Representation ℝ G (Fin (finrank ℂ V) → ℝ), IsRealForm ρ σ

/-- `Representation.IsRealizableOverReal` unfolded: it is the existence of a real form on the
pinned carrier, and this is the elimination principle for it. -/
theorem isRealizableOverReal_iff :
    IsRealizableOverReal ρ ↔
      ∃ σ : Representation ℝ G (Fin (finrank ℂ V) → ℝ), IsRealForm ρ σ :=
  (Iff.rfl)

/-- **A representation realizable over `ℝ` is finite-dimensional.**  The pinned carrier
`Fin (finrank ℂ V) → ℝ` is finite-dimensional, so `V`, being the complexification of it, is too.
This is what makes pinning the carrier by the dimension faithful. -/
theorem IsRealizableOverReal.finiteDimensional (h : IsRealizableOverReal ρ) :
    FiniteDimensional ℂ V := by
  obtain ⟨_, hσ⟩ := h
  exact hσ.finiteDimensional_iff.mp inferInstance

/-- **A real form on an arbitrary carrier realizes `ρ` over `ℝ`.**  Reading `σ` in a real basis of
`W` moves it to the pinned carrier: complexification does not change the dimension
(`Representation.IsRealForm.finrank_eq`), so a basis of `W` is indexed by `Fin (finrank ℂ V)`, and
conjugating `σ` by the resulting coordinate isomorphism turns the real form into one on
`Fin (finrank ℂ V) → ℝ`.  This is what makes `Representation.IsRealizableOverReal` usable from a
real form carried by whatever space it naturally lives on.

Finiteness is asked of `V`, the representation the conclusion speaks about; the carrier `W` of the
real form inherits it through `Representation.IsRealForm.finiteDimensional_iff`, which also takes a
consumer who has finiteness on the real side the other way. -/

the form in which realizability over `ℝ` is produced.
