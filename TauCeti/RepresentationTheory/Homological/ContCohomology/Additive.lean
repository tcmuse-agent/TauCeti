# Additivity and linearity of continuous cohomology

This file proves that the compatible-pair map on continuous cohomology is additive in its
coefficient morphism. Over a commutative coefficient ring it also commutes with scalar
multiplication. Consequently `Hⁿ(G, -)`, packaged as
`TauCeti.ContinuousCohomology.continuousCohomologyFunctor`, is an additive and linear functor.

The proof follows the construction through Mathlib's coinduced resolution: `resolutionMap`,
`cochainsMap`, `cocyclesMap`, and finally the induced map on homology. The cochain- and
cocycle-level statements are public because later constructions, in particular connecting maps
and cup products, need linearity before passing to cohomology.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ContinuousCohomology.map_add` and `TauCeti.ContinuousCohomology.map_smul` give
  additivity and linearity of the map associated to a compatible pair.
* `TauCeti.ContinuousCohomology.mapAddHom` and
  `TauCeti.ContinuousCohomology.mapLinearMap` bundle that dependence as an additive homomorphism
  and a linear map.
* `TauCeti.ContinuousCohomology.continuousCochainsFunctor` is the additive functor of
  homogeneous cochain complexes, with `continuousCochainsFunctorCompHomologyIso`; its action on
  maps of discrete modules is `cochainsMap_ofDiscreteModulePair_id`.
* `TauCeti.ContinuousCohomology.continuousCohomologyFunctor_additive` and
  `TauCeti.ContinuousCohomology.continuousCohomologyFunctor_linear` install the corresponding
  functor instances.
* `TauCeti.ContinuousCohomology.subsingleton_continuousCohomology_of_subsingleton`: continuous
  cohomology vanishes on subsingleton coefficients, a consequence of additivity.
