# The two-point graph cochain of the Evens norm at index two

Let `U` be a subgroup of index two of a topological group `G`, let `s` be an element outside `U`,
and let `α : U →* Multiplicative (ZMod 2)` be a continuous homomorphism, that is a continuous
`1`-cocycle of `U` with trivial `𝔽₂` coefficients. The multiplicative transfer (Evens norm)
`N^{Ev}(α) ∈ H²(G, 𝔽₂)` is, in this degree and at this index, the class of an explicit
`2`-cochain built from the two components of the Shapiro description of `α`:

```text
b₁ γ = α γ            (γ ∈ U),        b₁ γ = α (γ s)        (γ ∉ U),
b_s γ = b₁ (s⁻¹ γ),
ν (γ, η) = b₁ γ * b_s η                         (γ ∈ U),
ν (γ, η) = b₁ γ * b₁ η + b₁ η * b_s η           (γ ∉ U).
```

This file builds `b₁`, `b_s`, their sum and `ν`, and proves the cochain-level facts the class
`N^{Ev}(α)` and its characterizing identities rest on: `b₁` and `b_s` are the two coordinates of
a `1`-cocycle of `G` valued in the permutation module `𝔽₂[G/U]`, so their sum is a continuous
homomorphism `G → 𝔽₂`, and `ν` is a continuous `2`-cocycle whose class does not depend on the
element `s` chosen outside `U`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.evensExtend`: a homomorphism on `U`, extended by zero to `G`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.evensB1` and `TauCeti.ContCohomology.evensBs`: the two Shapiro
  components.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.evensCorCochain`: their sum, the shape the degree-one corestriction
  of `α` over the transversal `{1, s}` takes.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.evensGraphCochain`: the two-point graph `2`-cochain `ν`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.evensExtend_mul_hom`, `evensB1_mul_hom` and `evensBs_mul_hom`:
  the extension by zero and the two Shapiro components are additive in the homomorphism.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.evensB1_mul_of_mem`, `evensB1_mul_of_notMem`, `evensBs_mul_of_mem` and
  `evensBs_mul_of_notMem`: the cocycle law of the pair `(b₁, b_s)` in the permutation module,
  from which everything else follows.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.evensCorCochain_mul`: the sum `b₁ + b_s` is a homomorphism,
  which neither summand is.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.evensGraphCochain_cocycle_identity`: the `2`-cocycle identity for `ν`,
  in its trivial-action form.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.continuous_evensGraphCochain`: continuity of `ν`, for `U` open.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.evensGraphCochain_sub_evensGraphCochain`: two elements outside `U` give
  graph cochains differing by the explicit coboundary of
  `γ ↦ α (s⁻¹ s') * evensExtend U α γ`, so the class of `ν` depends on `U` and `α` alone.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.evensGraphCochain_apply_of_mem_of_mem`: on `U × U` the graph cochain is
  the cup-product cochain of `α` with its conjugate `η ↦ α (s⁻¹ η s)`.

## Implementation notes

`b₁` and `b_s` are cochains and **not** cocycles, so neither has a class of its own: for
`G = C₄ = ⟨σ⟩`, `U = ⟨σ²⟩`, `s = σ` and `α ≠ 0`, the values of `b₁` at `1, σ, σ², σ³` are
`0, 1, 1, 0`, so `b₁ (σ * σ) ≠ b₁ σ + b₁ σ`. Only the sum is a homomorphism; the section
`AcceptanceCheck` at the end of this file records that computation, which is why the
corestriction statement is about the sum and not about the two components separately.

The element `s` is data of the cochain formulas and of nothing else. Two elements outside `U`
give graph cochains differing by an explicit coboundary, so the class they define depends on `U`
and `α` alone; that is `TauCeti.ContCohomology.evensGraphCochain_sub_evensGraphCochain`, which is
stated at **every** `s'` outside `U` rather than at a chosen one.

Everything below is stated for a plain subgroup `U` together with the hypotheses `U.index = 2`
for the cocycle identities and the comparison of two elements outside `U`, and
`IsOpen (U : Set G)` for continuity. The evaluation of the graph cochain on `U × U` needs neither.
The continuity statements need only separately continuous multiplication, since the arguments use
fixed translations and the fact that an open subgroup is closed. No topology at all is needed for
the algebraic half: the cocycle laws and the comparison of two elements outside `U` are identities
of plain functions `G → 𝔽₂`.

The `2`-cocycle identity is stated in the form it takes for a trivial action, an equation between
sums of four values, rather than through `groupCohomology.IsCocycle₂`, whose statement carries a
scalar action of `G` on `𝔽₂` that nothing here has to fix.

Characteristic two is used only through `CharTwo.two_eq_zero` and `CharTwo.neg_eq`, and only in
three places: the `2`-cocycle identity when `γ` lies outside `U`, the comparison of two elements
outside `U`, and the fact that the extension by zero is invariant under inversion. The
corresponding identities over a general coefficient ring are false, which is why Evens' expansion
is restricted to even degrees away from characteristic two.

/-! ### The graph cochain on the subgroup

On `U × U` the graph cochain is the cup-product cochain of `α` with its conjugate by `s`, which
is again a homomorphism on `U` since `U` is normal at index two. This is the cochain form of the
identity `res_U N^{Ev}(α) = α ⌣ (s · α)`. -/

functions and needs no topology; the `1`-cochain whose coboundary it is becomes continuous once

/-! ### The two components are not cocycles

Evaluated at `(s, s)` neither Shapiro component is additive as soon as `α (s²) ≠ 0`, while their
sum is. The smallest instance is `G = C₄ = ⟨σ⟩` with `U = ⟨σ²⟩`, `s = σ` and `α ≠ 0`, where the
values of `b₁` at `1, σ, σ², σ³` are `0, 1, 1, 0`. Giving `b₁` and `b_s` classes of their own
would be a type error dressed as a statement, and this is the computation that catches it. -/
