# Continuous cohomology of a compact group is torsion in positive degrees

Let `G` be a compact group and `X` a topological representation of `G` whose underlying module is
discrete. Every class of `Hⁿ⁺¹(G, X) = continuousCohomology (n + 1) X` is killed by the index of
some open subgroup of `G`, so `Hⁿ⁺¹(G, X)` is a torsion group; and when `X` is a `ℚ`-vector space,
`Hⁿ⁺¹(G, X)` vanishes (NSW (1.6.1)). Degree zero is excluded on purpose: `H⁰(G, X) = X^G` is not
torsion in general, for instance for the trivial action on `ℤ`.

The argument runs on Mathlib's coinduced resolution `X → C(G, X) → C(G, C(G, X)) → ⋯`, whose
differentials are `d₀ = const` and `dₘ₊₁ F = const F - dₘ ∘ F`. Evaluation at any point `x : G`
contracts that resolution, `dₘ (F x) + (dₘ₊₁ F) x = F`, but it is not `G`-equivariant, so it does
not descend to the homogeneous cochains. The sum of the evaluations over a transversal of an open
subgroup `U` does descend, as soon as the cochain `F` is invariant under right translation by `U`.
A homogeneous cochain of a discrete representation of a compact group is locally constant, so its
right-translation stabilizer is such an open subgroup, of finite index `[G : U]`. Summing the
contraction identity over the cosets of `U` then exhibits `[G : U] • F` as a coboundary whenever
`F` is a cocycle of positive degree. For a `ℚ`-vector space `X`, division by `[G : U]` is an
endomorphism of `X`, and the additivity of `Hⁿ⁺¹(G, -)` turns the annihilation into vanishing.

The summed contraction identity is `TopRep.d_sum_apply_add_sum_d_apply`, and the invariance of the
coset sum is `ContRepresentation.sum_apply_out_mem_invariants`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ContinuousCohomology.exists_openSubgroup_index_nsmul_eq_zero`: every class of positive
  degree is killed by the index of an open subgroup.
* `TauCeti.ContinuousCohomology.isAddTorsion_continuousCohomology`: `Hⁿ⁺¹(G, X)` is torsion.
* `TauCeti.ContinuousCohomology.subsingleton_continuousCohomology_of_module_rat`: `Hⁿ⁺¹(G, X)`
  vanishes when `X` is a `ℚ`-vector space.
