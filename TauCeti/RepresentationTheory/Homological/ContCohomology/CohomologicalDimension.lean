# Cohomological dimension of a topological group

For a topological group `G`, a natural number `p` and `n : ℕ`, this file defines the two vanishing
predicates behind cohomological dimension, stated against Mathlib's continuous cohomology
`Hⁱ(G, M) = continuousCohomology i (ofDiscreteModule ℤ G M)` of discrete `G`-modules `M` with a
continuous action:

* `CohomologicalDimensionLE p G n`: `Hⁱ(G, M) = 0` for every `i > n` and every `p`-primary
  torsion `M`;
* `StrictCohomologicalDimensionLE p G n`: the `p`-primary component of `Hⁱ(G, M)` vanishes for
  every `i > n` and **every** `M`.

The two differ in both places at once: the ordinary predicate restricts the coefficients and asks
the whole group to vanish, the strict one allows all coefficients and asks only the `p`-primary
part to vanish. The `p`-cohomological dimension `cd_p G = cohomologicalDimensionAt p G` and the
strict one `scd_p G = strictCohomologicalDimensionAt p G` are the least `n` in `ℕ∞` satisfying
them (`⊤` when none does), and the cohomological dimension `cd G = cohomologicalDimension G` is
the supremum of `cd_p G` over the primes `p`.

The first comparison between them is `cd_p G ≤ scd_p G` for compact `G` (NSW (3.3.3)). It rests
on `isPPrimaryTorsion_continuousCohomology`: over a compact group, the continuous cohomology of a
discrete `p`-primary torsion representation is `p`-primary torsion in every degree. A continuous
cochain out of a compact group into a discrete module has finite image, so a single power of `p`
kills it; that bound propagates through the iterated function spaces of the homogeneous cochain
complex, and hence to its homology.

For `G : Type u` the coefficient modules `M` range over `Type (max u v)` for an extra universe `v`:
Mathlib's continuous cohomology needs the coefficients in a universe containing that of `G`, since
its resolution is built from `C(G, -)`. Since `v` does not appear in the arguments, it is the first
universe parameter of every definition here and is written explicitly, as in
`cohomologicalDimensionAt.{v} p G`.

The definitions do not use that `p` is prime; they are meant for prime `p`, where `p`-primary is
the intended notion.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.CohomologicalDimensionLE`, `TauCeti.StrictCohomologicalDimensionLE`: the vanishing
  predicates.
* `TauCeti.cohomologicalDimensionAt`, `TauCeti.strictCohomologicalDimensionAt`,
  `TauCeti.cohomologicalDimension`: the invariants `cd_p`, `scd_p` and `cd`, valued in `ℕ∞`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isPPrimaryTorsion_continuousCohomology`: continuous cohomology of a discrete
  `p`-primary torsion representation of a compact group is `p`-primary torsion.
* `TauCeti.cohomologicalDimensionAt_le_iff`, `TauCeti.strictCohomologicalDimensionAt_le_iff`,
  `TauCeti.cohomologicalDimension_le_iff`: each invariant is at most `n` exactly when the
  corresponding predicate holds at `n`.
* `TauCeti.cohomologicalDimensionAt_le_strictCohomologicalDimensionAt`: `cd_p G ≤ scd_p G` for
  compact `G`.
