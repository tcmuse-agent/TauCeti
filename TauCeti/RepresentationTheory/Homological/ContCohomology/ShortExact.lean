# Short exact sequences of discrete modules, and the low-degree connecting maps

A short exact sequence `0 → A → B → C → 0` of **discrete** `G`-modules induces short exact
sequences of *continuous* cochains

```text
0 → Cⁿ(G, A) → Cⁿ(G, B) → Cⁿ(G, C) → 0,
```

and hence connecting homomorphisms `δ⁰ : H⁰(G, C) → H¹(G, A)` and `δ¹ : H¹(G, C) → H²(G, A)` on
the explicit low-degree complex of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Homological/ContCohomology/LowDegree.lean`. This file builds both.

Discreteness of the coefficients is used twice, once at each of the two ends of the sequence.
Discreteness of `C` gives surjectivity on cochains: a continuous cochain into `C` is locally
constant, so composing it with *any* set-theoretic section of `B → C` is still continuous
(`TauCeti.ContCohomology.exists_continuous_lift`). Discreteness of `A` and of `B` gives exactness
in the middle: an injection of discrete spaces reflects continuity
(`TauCeti.ContCohomology.continuous_of_injective_comp`), so a continuous cochain into `B` that the
projection kills retracts to a *continuous* cochain into `A`
(`TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.exists_continuous_incl_comp_eq`, whence
`C1_map_incl_eq_inf_ker`); it is also what makes `incl` and `proj` continuous. For general
topological coefficients neither argument applies, since a set-theoretic section need not be
continuous and a continuous cochain need not be locally constant; the cochain sequence can still
be exact when suitable continuous lifts exist. Nothing below is asserted in that more general
setting.

The sequence is carried by a structure rather than by loose hypotheses because every statement
here — and, later, the compatibility of corestriction with the connecting maps — is about the same
sequence and has to name the same two coefficient maps.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact`: a short exact sequence of discrete `G`-modules.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.toShortComplex`: the sequence as a short
  complex of canonical topological coefficient representations.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.restrict`: the same sequence over a subgroup.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.ofAddSubgroup`: the sequence `0 → N → B → B ⧸ N → 0`
  of a `G`-stable additive subgroup `N` of a discrete `G`-module `B`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.inclDistribMulActionHom` and
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.projDistribMulActionHom`: the inclusion and projection
  bundled as equivariant additive homomorphisms, suitable as inputs to `explicitCoeff0`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.explicitDelta0` and
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.explicitDelta1`: the connecting homomorphisms
  `H⁰(G, C) → H¹(G, A)` and `H¹(G, C) → H²(G, A)`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.exists_continuous_lift`: a continuous cochain on any topological space
  lifts along any surjection onto a discrete space. This is the degree-agnostic form of
  surjectivity of `Cⁿ(G, B) → Cⁿ(G, C)`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.continuous_of_injective_comp`: an injection of discrete spaces reflects
  continuity. This is the degree-agnostic form of exactness in the middle.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.compLeft_incl_injective`,
  `C1_map_incl_eq_inf_ker` and `C1_map_proj_eq_C1`: exactness of
  `0 → C¹(X, A) → C¹(X, B) → C¹(X, C) → 0` at its left, middle and right nodes, with
  `C2_map_incl_eq_inf_ker` and `C2_map_proj_eq_C2` the degree-`2` instances of the last two.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.mem_Z1_of_incl_comp_mem_Z1` and
  `mem_Z2_of_incl_comp_mem_Z2`: the continuous cocycles descend along the inclusion, which is what
  turns a cochain produced by a diagram chase back into a cocycle on `A`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.explicitDelta0_apply` and
  `explicitDelta1_apply`: the two connecting maps evaluated on representatives, in the shape of
  Mathlib's discrete `groupCohomology.δ₀_apply` and `δ₁_apply`. They hold for an *arbitrary*
  preimage and an arbitrary representing cocycle, so they are also the public form of the
  well-definedness of the two maps. Their cocycle hypotheses are discharged by
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteShortExact.mem_Z1_of_incl_comp_eq_d0` and
  `mem_Z2_of_incl_comp_eq_d1`, which need no cocycle input of their own.

## Implementation notes

Continuity of `incl` and of `proj` is *not* carried as data: `A` and `B` are discrete, so every
map out of them is continuous. Exactness in the middle is Mathlib's `Function.Exact`, which is
`∀ b, proj b = 0 ↔ b ∈ Set.range incl`.

The cochain maps are Mathlib's `AddMonoidHom.compLeft`, postcomposition on a function space; the
statements of exactness are therefore about the image and kernel of that homomorphism restricted
to the cochain subgroup `C¹ X -`, which is `C¹(G, -)` at `X = G` and `C²(G, -)` at `X = G × G`.
The compatible-pair pullback of Layer 2 is a different map — it moves the group as well as the
coefficients — and is not used here.

Both connecting maps are built from a *variable* preimage first, and the independence of the
choice is a theorem rather than a definitional accident; only then is the map defined by choosing
a preimage with `Function.surjInv`. The cochain-level constructions this passes through are
private, including the retraction used on the kernel of the projection, since they depend on
choices the mathematical statements must not mention; the public interface to them is
`explicitDelta0_apply` and `explicitDelta1_apply`, which hold with whatever preimage a computation
has in hand.

The cochain sequences are stated for a topological monoid `G`. The two connecting maps ask in
addition that the coefficients be discrete `G`-modules with a *continuous* action,
`[ContinuousSMul G A]` and `[ContinuousSMul G B]`: without it `B¹ ≤ Z¹` and `B² ≤ Z²` fail and the
quotients `H1` and `H2` cannot be formed. `δ¹` asks moreover for a continuous multiplication on
`G`, which is what carries continuity through `d¹`. `DiscreteShortExact.restrict` is the one
exception in the other direction: restricting the sequence to a subgroup asks `G` to be a group.
Profiniteness plays no part in this layer.

This implements the "exactness of cochains" and "the short exact sequence as data" milestones of
Layer 5 of the human-authored roadmap at `TauCetiRoadmap/ProfiniteCohomology/README.md`, together
with the two connecting maps and their descriptions on representatives from that layer's long
exact sequence milestone, whose `Suggested.lean` fixes the names `DiscreteShortExact`,
`DiscreteShortExact.restrict`, `explicitDelta0`, `explicitDelta0_apply`, `explicitDelta1` and
`explicitDelta1_apply`.

discreteness of `A` and `B` makes the inclusion reflect continuity, which is what retracts a
continuous cochain killed by the projection. Continuity of the two maps is a further consequence
of it, not data. -/
