# The cup product on continuous cohomology

Let `P : TopPairing X Y Z` be an equivariant jointly continuous bilinear pairing of topological
representations of a topological group `G`. The Alexander–Whitney cup product of homogeneous
cochains `TauCeti.TopPairing.cupCochain` satisfies the Leibniz rule
`d (a ⌣ b) = d a ⌣ b + (-1)^m (a ⌣ d b)`, so a cocycle cupped with a cocycle is a cocycle, and a
coboundary cupped with a cocycle, or a cocycle with a coboundary, is a coboundary. This file
descends the cup product accordingly, first to the cocycles and then to Mathlib's continuous
cohomology, giving the bilinear map

```text
cup P m n : Hᵐ(G, X) →ₗ[R] Hⁿ(G, Y) →ₗ[R] Hᵐ⁺ⁿ(G, Z),
```

determined by `cup P m n [a] [b] = [a ⌣ b]` on classes of cocycles (`TauCeti.TopPairing.cup_π`).
Biadditivity, and more generally `R`-bilinearity, is carried by the type: additivity in either
argument is `LinearMap.map_add₂` and `map_add`.

The descent runs through `HomologicalComplex.descHomologyₗ`, the elementwise universal property of
homology in `TopModuleCat R`: a linear map out of the cycles that vanishes on the kernel of the
class map factors through the homology. It is applied twice, once in each variable, which is why
that universal property is stated for linear maps into an arbitrary module rather than for
morphisms of `TopModuleCat R`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.TopPairing.cupCocycles`: the cup product of cocycles.
* `TauCeti.TopPairing.cup`: the cup product on continuous cohomology.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.TopPairing.iCycles_cupCocycles`: the cup product of cocycles is, on underlying
  cochains, the cup product of cochains.
* `TauCeti.TopPairing.homologyπ_cupCocycles_eq_zero_of_left_eq_zero` and
  `TauCeti.TopPairing.homologyπ_cupCocycles_eq_zero_of_right_eq_zero`: the cup product of a
  coboundary with a cocycle, in either order, is a coboundary.
* `TauCeti.TopPairing.cup_π`: the cup product of the classes of two cocycles is the class of their
  cup product.
