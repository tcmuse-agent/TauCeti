# The explicit low-degree complex of continuous cochains

Continuous cochain cohomology of a topological group `G` acting on a topological module `M` is
computed in low degrees by an explicit complex of *plain functions carrying continuity as a
predicate*: `C¹` is the additive subgroup of continuous elements of `G → M` and `C²` the
subgroup of continuous elements of `G × G → M`. This file builds that complex, its differentials,
its cocycles and coboundaries, and the three low-degree cohomology groups

```text
H⁰(G, M) = M^G,   H¹(G, M) = Z¹/B¹,   H²(G, M) = Z²/B².
```

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.C1`, `TauCeti.ContCohomology.C2`: the continuous cochains.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.d0`, `d1`, `d2`: the inhomogeneous differentials, as additive
  homomorphisms of the ambient function groups.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.Z1`, `Z2`: the continuous cocycles, `Cⁱ ⊓ ker dⁱ`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.B1`, `B2`: the coboundaries, `range d⁰` and the image `d¹(C¹)` of the
  *continuous* `1`-cochains.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.H0`, `H1`, `H2`, their class maps `H1pi`, `H2pi`, and the discrete
  carriers `DiscreteH1`, `DiscreteH2` used by the comparison with canonical cohomology, together
  with their identifications `discreteH1Equiv`, `discreteH2Equiv` with `H1` and `H2`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitMap0`: the compatible-pair pullback on the explicit degree-zero
  carrier, with `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitRes0` and `explicitCoeff0` its two named
  instances.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.d1_comp_d0` and `TauCeti.ContCohomology.d2_comp_d1`: `d ∘ d = 0`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.B1_le_Z1` and `TauCeti.ContCohomology.B2_le_Z2`: the form of `d ∘ d = 0`
  that the two quotients need, coboundaries being continuous.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.subsingleton_H1_of_subsingleton` and
  `subsingleton_H2_of_subsingleton`: a trivial group has vanishing `H¹` and `H²`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.subsingleton_H1_of_subsingleton_coefficients` and
  `subsingleton_H2_of_subsingleton_coefficients`: trivial coefficients have vanishing `H¹` and
  `H²`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.H1EquivOfSmulEqSelf`: for a trivial action, `H¹(G, M)` is the group of
  continuous homomorphisms `G →ₜ* Multiplicative M`. This is the statement that makes `H¹` of a
  profinite group computable, and it is false without continuity.

## Implementation notes

The differentials and the cocycle identities follow the conventions of Mathlib's
`Mathlib/RepresentationTheory/Homological/GroupCohomology/LowDegree.lean`:

```text
(d⁰ m) g       = g • m - m,
(d¹ f) (g, h)  = g • f h - f (g * h) + f g,
(d² f) (g, h, j) = g • f (h, j) - f (g * h, j) + f (g, h * j) - f (g, h).
```

The cocycle conditions are spelled by Mathlib's unbundled predicates
`groupCohomology.IsCocycle₁` and `groupCohomology.IsCocycle₂`, and
`TauCeti.ContCohomology.d1_apply_eq_zero_iff` and `d2_apply_eq_zero_iff` identify them with the
vanishing of the differentials, so that `Zⁱ = Cⁱ ⊓ ker dⁱ` — which is how `Z1` and `Z2` are
*defined*, taking their closure under the group operations from `AddMonoidHom.ker` — is stated in
that spelling by `mem_Z1_iff` and `mem_Z2_iff`.

Mathlib's bundled `groupCohomology.cocycles₁` and `cocycles₂` are *not* reused here: they are
stated for `Rep k G`, which forces the coefficient ring and the group into a single universe, and
the coefficient modules of a profinite group have to be allowed to live in the group's universe
with a small coefficient ring such as `ℤ`. The unbundled `IsCocycle₁`/`IsCocycle₂` predicates,
which Mathlib provides for exactly this purpose, carry no such constraint and are consumed
directly. The cochain groups themselves are Mathlib's `continuousAddSubgroup`.

The trivial-action results are the continuous analogues of Mathlib's
`groupCohomology.cocycles₁IsoOfIsTrivial`, `groupCohomology.coboundaries₁_eq_bot_of_isTrivial` and
`groupCohomology.H1IsoOfIsTrivial`, in the same order and with the same proof plan; they are
restated for the unbundled classes because the Mathlib versions are stated for `Rep k G`.

Cochains are not normalised: `f 1 = 0` in degree `1` and the degree-`2` normalisations are the
lemmas `map_one_of_mem_Z1`, `map_one_fst_of_mem_Z2` and `map_one_snd_of_mem_Z2`, never
definitional conditions.

`H1` and `H2` divide `Z¹` and `Z²` by the coboundaries *viewed inside the cocycles*, in the
`AddSubgroup.addSubgroupOf` spelling the roadmap fixes, so that no proof term enters either quotient
subgroup. Each carrier retains the hypotheses of `TauCeti.ContCohomology.B1_le_Z1`, respectively
`B2_le_Z2`, through that inclusion theorem, so the subgroup divided out is always the whole of
`B¹`, respectively `B²`, and never the intersection `B ⊓ Z` that `addSubgroupOf` would cut out at a
weaker generality; `AddSubgroup.map_addSubgroupOf_eq_of_le` turns those inclusions into that
identity whenever a consumer needs it spelled out. The two carriers therefore sit in separate
sections:
`H¹` needs `G` to be a monoid acting continuously, and `H²` needs a continuous multiplication on
`G` besides, because `d¹` has to preserve continuity for `B² = d¹(C¹)` to consist of cocycles.

This implements the "the complex" milestone of Layer 2 of the human-authored roadmap at
`TauCetiRoadmap/ProfiniteCohomology/README.md`, whose §3 fixes every convention above and whose
`Suggested.lean` fixes the names `C1`, `C2`, `d0`, `d1`, `Z1`, `Z2`, `B1`, `B2`, `H0`, `H1`, `H2`,
`H1pi`, `H2pi`, `B1_le_Z1` and `B2_le_Z2`.

topology on `G → M`, and that topology is not the intended one: it need not be discrete, the

`groupCohomology.H1IsoOfIsTrivial`.

Continuity is what makes this useful rather than decorative: without it the right-hand side is the
group of abstract homomorphisms, which for a profinite group is enormous. -/
