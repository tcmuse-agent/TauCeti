# The character projections

The conjugate `conj χ_π` of the character of a continuous representation `π` of a compact group is
a class function, so it acts on a finite-dimensional irreducible representation by a scalar
(`TauCeti.ContRepresentation.integratedOperator_eq_smul_id`, from
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Integrated.lean`). Its Haar integral against another character
`χ_ρ` is the `L²` inner product of the two characters, so the character orthogonality relations of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Character/Basic.lean` evaluate that scalar. This file records
the two resulting **character projections**, for `π` finite-dimensional irreducible and unitary:

* the kernel `dim V_π · conj χ_π` acts as the identity on `V_π` itself;
* `conj χ_π` acts as zero on a finite-dimensional `ρ` admitting no nonzero continuous intertwiner
  `ρ → π`.

These are the two blockwise identities from which the isotypic projectors are built. Their assembly
on a reducible representation is carried out in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Character/IsotypicProjection.lean`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.integral_star_character_mul_character`: pairing a character with the
  conjugate of another one is the `L²` inner product of the two characters.
* `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.integratedOperator_star_character_self`: `conj χ_π` acts on `V_π` by
  the scalar `(dim V_π)⁻¹`, so that, by
  `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.finrank_smul_integratedOperator_star_character_self`, the kernel
  `dim V_π · conj χ_π` acts as the identity on `V_π`.
* `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.integratedOperator_star_character_eq_zero`: for `π` unitary,
  `conj χ_π` acts as zero on a representation admitting no nonzero continuous intertwiner into
  `π`.

## Implementation notes

The scalar in `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.integratedOperator_eq_smul_id` is
`(dim V)⁻¹ · ∫ f · χ_π`, not `∫ f · conj χ_π`: the integrand pairs the acting function with the
character itself, and the conjugation appears only here, where the acting function is specialized
to `conj χ_π` and `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.integral_star_character_mul_character` identifies the
integral with Mathlib's sesquilinear `L²` inner product of the two characters.

finite-dimensional irreducible unitary representation of dimension `d`, the integrated operator of

The scalar is `d⁻¹` rather than `1` exactly because the character has `L²` norm one: the projection
kernel that acts as the identity is `d · conj χ_π`, which is
`TauCeti.ContRepresentation.finrank_smul_integratedOperator_star_character_self`. -/
