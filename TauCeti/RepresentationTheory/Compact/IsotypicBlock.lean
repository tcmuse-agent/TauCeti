# The isotypic blocks of `L²(G)`

The Peter-Weyl theorem (`TauCeti.peterWeylBasis`) exhibits a Hilbert basis of `L²(G)` indexed by
the matrix positions `Σ i, Fin dᵢ × Fin dᵢ` of a skeleton of the unitary dual of a compact group
`G`. Grouping those positions by the model they belong to splits `L²(G)` into one **block** for
each irreducible, and this file builds that splitting.

The block `TauCeti.peterWeylBlock model` of an irreducible model is the span, inside `L²(G)`, of
*all* matrix coefficients of that model -- not only the normalized basis ones. It depends on
nothing but the model, and in fact only on its equivalence class
(`TauCeti.peterWeylBlock_eq_of_equiv`); a family of models enters only where several blocks are
compared. The two
spans agree (`TauCeti.peterWeylBlock_eq_span_range`), because expanding the two defining vectors in
the canonical orthonormal basis of the model writes an arbitrary matrix coefficient as a
combination of the `dᵢ²` basis ones; in particular every block is finite-dimensional
(`TauCeti.finiteDimensional_peterWeylBlock`).

When `𝕜` is **algebraically closed** those `dᵢ²` coefficients are moreover orthonormal, hence an
orthonormal basis of the block (`TauCeti.peterWeylBlockOrthonormalBasis`), the block has dimension
`dᵢ²` (`TauCeti.finrank_peterWeylBlock`), and matching a matrix position with the matrix unit at
that position identifies the block with `End(V_π)` (`TauCeti.endEquivPeterWeylBlock`). Every one of
those four statements assumes `[IsAlgClosed 𝕜]`, and genuinely needs it: the normalization `√dᵢ` of
the coefficients cancels the diagonal value `dᵢ⁻¹` of the first Schur orthogonality relation
(`TauCeti.ContRepresentation.orthonormal_matrixCoeffLp`), which is `dᵢ⁻¹` because the endomorphism
algebra of the model is `𝕜`. Over a `𝕜` that is not algebraically closed the `dᵢ²` coefficients need
not even be independent: for the two-dimensional real rotation representation of the cyclic group of
order three the four of them span a block of dimension two, not four.

Distinct blocks are orthogonal, by the second Schur orthogonality relation
(`TauCeti.ContRepresentation.schur_orthogonality`), and together they span `L²(G)` densely,
because their supremum is the span of the whole Peter-Weyl family. So `L²(G)` is the Hilbert sum
of the blocks (`TauCeti.isHilbertSum_peterWeylBlock`), whose `IsHilbertSum.linearIsometryEquiv` is
an isometry of `L²(G)` onto the `ℓ²` sum of the **block subspaces**; that much is true for every
`RCLike 𝕜`. For an algebraically closed `𝕜`, reading each block in its orthonormal basis transports
that isometry to the `ℓ²` sum of the endomorphism spaces of the models
(`TauCeti.isHilbertSum_euclideanSpace_peterWeylBlock`), an isometry of Hilbert spaces
`L²(G) ≅ ⨁̂_π End(V_π)`. The summand `End(V_π)` is spelled there as
`EuclideanSpace 𝕜 (Fin dᵢ × Fin dᵢ)`, the matrices in the canonical basis of the model with their
Hilbert-Schmidt inner product `⟪a, b⟫ = ∑ conj aⱼₖ * bⱼₖ`, because `Module.End` carries no inner
product instance in Mathlib. That spelling loses nothing:
`TauCeti.repr_endEquivPeterWeylBlock_basis_end` reads `TauCeti.endEquivPeterWeylBlock` in the
matrix units and finds the standard basis vectors, which are the orthonormal basis of the
Hilbert-Schmidt structure.

Each block also carries its **character averaging operator** `TauCeti.peterWeylBlockAveraging`,
the convolution operator of the kernel `dim V_π · conj χ_π`.
Convolution moves the group argument of a matrix coefficient, hence acts on the defining vectors of
the coefficient through the integrated operator of that kernel on the model's carrier. That
operator is zero on an inequivalent model over any `𝕜`, and the identity on the model itself when
`𝕜` is algebraically closed, so the averaging always kills every other block and is the identity
on the `π`-block for an algebraically closed `𝕜`; its kernel being symmetric it is self-adjoint,
and for a skeleton of the unitary dual every element of `L²(G)` is carried into the `π`-block, so
it *is* the orthogonal projection of `L²(G)` onto that block
(`TauCeti.peterWeylBlockAveraging_eq_starProjection`). That is the sense in which averaging against
the character is the isotypic projector here: it is a statement about the orthogonal projection onto
a subspace of `L²(G)`, not about a `G`-isotypic decomposition.

The operator is defined for every `RCLike 𝕜`, and is deliberately *not* named a projection, because
over a `𝕜` that is not algebraically closed it need not be one: on a model whose endomorphism
algebra is larger than `𝕜` the kernel `dim V_π · conj χ_π` scales the block by the dimension of that
algebra -- for the two-dimensional real rotation representation of the cyclic group of order three
it is `2 • id` on its block. Every statement identifying the averaging with the projection onto the
block therefore assumes `[IsAlgClosed 𝕜]`.

The results about a single block -- the orthonormal family, the basis, the dimension, the
comparison with `End(V_π)` -- assume nothing about the rest of the family, only that `𝕜` is
algebraically closed. Pairwise inequivalence
of the models is what makes distinct blocks orthogonal and independent, and exhaustiveness of the
skeleton enters exactly where density is claimed.

## What is not proved here

Every statement in this file is a statement about Hilbert spaces, their subspaces, their isometries
and their bounded operators. The blocks are called *isotypic* because the `π`-block is spanned by
the matrix coefficients of `π` alone; that it is the `π`-isotypic component of a `G`-action, and
that the decomposition of `L²(G)` is one of unitary `G × G`-representations under left and right
translation, are statements about group actions and are **not** proved here. What is proved about
the action is that each block is stable under both translations
(`TauCeti.compMeasurePreserving_mulLeft_mem_peterWeylBlock` and
`TauCeti.rightRegularLp_mem_peterWeylBlock`), because translation carries matrix coefficients of a
model to matrix coefficients of the same model
(`TauCeti.ContRepresentation.matrixCoeff_comp_mulLeft` and
`TauCeti.ContRepresentation.matrixCoeff_comp_mulRight`). Equivariance of the identification of a
block with `End(V_π)` is not proved either, and what it needs is a `G × G`-action on each side:
bi-translation `((g, h) · f) x = f (g⁻¹ * x * h)` on `L²(G)`, of which only the right factor is in
the library (`TauCeti.rightRegularLp`), and `(g, h) · A = π g ∘ A ∘ π h⁻¹` on `End(V_π)`, together
with the proof that the identification intertwines them. No `G × G`-action is defined in the
library, and `TauCeti.endEquivPeterWeylBlock` is built from the canonical basis of the model, so
nothing is claimed here about its equivariance. The character averaging operator
`TauCeti.peterWeylBlockAveraging` *is* built here, but not as an instance of
`TauCeti.ContRepresentation.isotypicProjector`: that projector is built from
`TauCeti.ContRepresentation.integratedOperator` for a *finite-dimensional* carrier and a
norm-continuous representation, while `L²(G)` is in general infinite-dimensional and its regular
representation then only strongly continuous (`TauCeti.continuous_rightRegularLp_apply`). Both
obstructions disappear for a finite `G`, where `L²(G)` has dimension `|G|`; but nothing here
assumes `G` finite, so the general route is the one taken. The averaging is carried out instead by
`TauCeti.convolutionOperator`, which needs no continuity of the action on `L²(G)`, and the
integrated operator is used only on the finite-dimensional carrier of a model, where it is
available.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.peterWeylBlock`: the span in `L²(G)` of the matrix coefficients of one model.
* `TauCeti.peterWeylBlockOrthonormalBasis`: for an algebraically closed `𝕜`, the orthonormal basis
  of the block given by the `dᵢ²` normalized matrix coefficients of its model; its
  `OrthonormalBasis.repr` is the isometry of the block onto the Hilbert-Schmidt space
  `EuclideanSpace 𝕜 (Fin dᵢ × Fin dᵢ)`.
* `TauCeti.endEquivPeterWeylBlock`: **for an algebraically closed `𝕜` the block is a copy of
  `End(V_π)`**, matching the matrix unit at a position with the normalized matrix coefficient at
  that position.
* `TauCeti.peterWeylBlockAveraging`: **the character averaging operator of the block**,
  convolution against the kernel `dim V_π · conj χ_π`; for an algebraically closed `𝕜` it is the
  orthogonal projection onto the block.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.peterWeylBlock_eq_span_range`: the block is already spanned by the `dᵢ²` normalized
  matrix coefficients of the Peter-Weyl family that belong to it.
* `TauCeti.finrank_peterWeylBlock`: **for an algebraically closed `𝕜` the block has dimension
  `dᵢ²`**.
* `TauCeti.peterWeylBlock_eq_of_equiv` and `TauCeti.peterWeylBlockAveraging_eq_of_equiv`: **the
  block and its character averaging operator depend on the model only through its equivalence
  class**, so they identify the same isotypic component of `L²(G)` whichever model of `π` is
  chosen.
* `TauCeti.toLp_star_character_mem_peterWeylBlock`: the conjugate character of a model lies in its
  own block, spanning the trace direction of it.
* `TauCeti.rightRegularLp_mem_peterWeylBlock` and
  `TauCeti.compMeasurePreserving_mulLeft_mem_peterWeylBlock`: **each block is stable under right
  and left translation**.
* `TauCeti.isOrtho_peterWeylBlock`, `TauCeti.orthogonalFamily_peterWeylBlock`: **the blocks of
  inequivalent models are orthogonal**, so the blocks of a family of pairwise inequivalent models
  form an orthogonal family of subspaces, and `TauCeti.iSupIndep_peterWeylBlock` that they are
  independent.
* `TauCeti.iSup_peterWeylBlock_eq_span_peterWeylFamily`: their supremum is the span of the
  Peter-Weyl family.
* `TauCeti.orthogonal_iSup_peterWeylBlock_eq_bot` and
  `TauCeti.topologicalClosure_iSup_peterWeylBlock`: **the blocks are dense in `L²(G)`**, whence
  `TauCeti.isHilbertSum_peterWeylBlock`: `L²(G)` is the Hilbert sum of the blocks.
* `TauCeti.isHilbertSum_euclideanSpace_peterWeylBlock`: **for an algebraically closed `𝕜`, `L²(G)`
  is isometrically the Hilbert sum of the endomorphism spaces of the models**, each carrying its
  Hilbert-Schmidt inner product.
* `TauCeti.peterWeylBlockAveraging_apply_of_mem` and
  `TauCeti.peterWeylBlockAveraging_apply_eq_zero_of_mem`: **the character averaging operator kills
  the block of an inequivalent model, and for an algebraically closed `𝕜` is the identity on its
  own block**, the two blockwise identities of the averaging kernel. Only the second needs the
  algebraic closure.
* `TauCeti.peterWeylBlockAveraging_eq_starProjection` and
  `TauCeti.range_peterWeylBlockAveraging`: **for an algebraically closed `𝕜` the character
  averaging operator is the orthogonal projection of `L²(G)` onto the block**, whose range is
  therefore the block itself; this is the statement that the character averages are the isotypic
  projectors.

/-! ### The character averaging operator of a block

Averaging the right translations of `L²(G)` against the kernel `dim V_π · conj χ_π` projects
`L²(G)` onto the `π`-block when `𝕜` is algebraically closed. The averaging is convolution
(`TauCeti.convolutionOperator`), which is
bounded on `L²(G)` for a continuous kernel and needs no continuity of the action of `G` on `L²(G)`;
on a matrix coefficient it moves the group argument, so it acts through the integrated operator of
the same kernel on the finite-dimensional carrier of the model, where the character identities of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Character/Projection.lean` evaluate it. -/

/-- Convolving a matrix coefficient of a model against a continuous kernel `k` gives the matrix
coefficient at the same first vector and at the second vector moved by the integrated operator of
`k` on the model's carrier.

This is the computation behind `TauCeti.peterWeylBlockAveraging`, and it is where the unitarity of
the model is used: convolution translates the group argument of the coefficient, and for a unitary
action the translation may be moved from the first vector to the second. -/

`dim V_π · conj χ_π`.

It kills the block of an inequivalent model
(`TauCeti.peterWeylBlockAveraging_apply_eq_zero_of_mem`), and when `𝕜` is algebraically closed it is
the identity on the `π`-block (`TauCeti.peterWeylBlockAveraging_apply_of_mem`), because the
integrated operator of that kernel on the carrier of a model is zero for an inequivalent model and,
over such a `𝕜`, the identity for `π` itself. For a skeleton of the unitary dual those two
identities make it the orthogonal projection of `L²(G)` onto the block
(`TauCeti.peterWeylBlockAveraging_eq_starProjection`).

It is not called a projection, because over a `𝕜` that is not algebraically closed it need not be
one: the kernel scales the block by the dimension over `𝕜` of the endomorphism algebra of the
model, which is `2 • id` for the two-dimensional real rotation representation of the cyclic group of
