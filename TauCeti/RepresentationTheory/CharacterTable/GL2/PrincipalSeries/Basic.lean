# The principal series of `GL₂(𝔽_q)`

A pair of characters `α, β : Fˣ →* ℂˣ` of the multiplicative group of a field inflates through the
split torus to a one-dimensional character of the Borel subgroup `B = T U` of upper-triangular
matrices, on which the unipotent radical acts trivially. Inducing that character up to `GL₂` is
**parabolic induction**, and the resulting representation

`GL2PrincipalSeries F α β = Ind_B^{GL₂} (α ⊗ β)`

is the **principal series**. Over a finite field with `q` elements the Borel subgroup has index
`q + 1`, so the principal series has dimension `q + 1`.

This file builds the characters of `B`, the one-dimensional representations carrying them, the
principal series itself, and its dimension. The irreducibility criterion `α ≠ β` is proved in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/GL2/PrincipalSeries/Irreducible.lean`; the
decomposition of the boundary case `α = β` into a linear character and the Steinberg
representation is not proved here.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GL2Borel.linearChar`: the character `b ↦ α b₁₁ · β b₂₂` of the Borel subgroup obtained
  by inflating a pair of characters through the split torus.
* `TauCeti.GL2Borel.linearRep`: the one-dimensional representation carrying that character.
* `TauCeti.GL2BorelRep`: the same representation as an object of `FDRep ℂ B`.
* `TauCeti.GL2PrincipalSeries`: the principal series `Ind_B^{GL₂}(α ⊗ β)`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.GL2Borel.linearChar_unipotentHom`: the character is trivial on the unipotent radical, so
  it is genuinely inflated from the split torus (`TauCeti.GL2Borel.linearChar_torusHom`).
* `TauCeti.GL2Borel.linearChar_inj`: the pair `(α, β)` is recovered from the character it
  inflates to, so distinct pairs give distinct one-dimensional representations of `B`.
* `TauCeti.GL2Borel.linearChar_self`: for `α = β` the Borel character is the determinant twisted by
  `α`; this is the boundary case whose principal series is reducible.
* `TauCeti.GL2Borel.character_linearRep`: the character of a one-dimensional representation is the
  scalar it acts by.
* `TauCeti.GL2Borel.linearRep_def`: the representation is the generic one-dimensional
  representation associated to `TauCeti.GL2Borel.linearChar`.
* `TauCeti.GL2BorelRep_def`: the bundled Borel representation is `TauCeti.GL2Borel.linearRep`, the
  form to reason from when the action itself, and not only its character, is needed.
* `TauCeti.GL2Borel.nonempty_iso_borelRep_iff`: two inducing Borel lines are isomorphic exactly
  when their ordered parameter pairs agree.
* `TauCeti.finrank_GL2PrincipalSeries` and `TauCeti.character_one_GL2PrincipalSeries`: the
  principal series has dimension `q + 1`.

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.GL2Borel.linearChar` and `TauCeti.GL2Borel.linearRep` are stated over an arbitrary
commutative ring `R` for the group — the Borel subgroup itself is defined over any commutative
ring — and over the weakest coefficients each needs: the character only multiplies values in `kˣ`,
so it lives over a `CommMonoid k`, while the representation needs a module structure on the line
and so lives over a `CommSemiring k`. Nothing in the inflation uses finiteness or the complex
numbers, and neither does its bundled form `TauCeti.GL2BorelRep`, which is therefore stated over a
`CommRing F`; the field and finiteness hypotheses enter only with `TauCeti.GL2PrincipalSeries`,
where they supply the finite index that makes induction finite-dimensional.

The construction is universe-polymorphic in `F`. Although Mathlib's raw induced representation
has a carrier in the universe of the group, `TauCeti.indFDRep` transports it to an equivalent small
model whose carrier lies in the universe of the coefficient ring. It therefore produces an object
of `FDRep ℂ (GL (Fin 2) F)` without restricting the universe of `F`.

`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTheory/Suggested.lean` pins `GL2PrincipalSeries`
with a `[DecidableEq F]` hypothesis. It is not needed: `GL (Fin 2) F` needs decidable equality only
on the index type `Fin 2`, and carrying an unused instance argument would be flagged by the
`unusedArguments` linter, so it is dropped here.
