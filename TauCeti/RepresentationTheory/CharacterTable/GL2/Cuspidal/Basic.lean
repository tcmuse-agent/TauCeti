# The cuspidal virtual character of `GL₂(𝔽_q)`

Let `F` be a finite field with `q` elements, `E/F` a degree-`2` extension, `θ` a character of `Eˣ`
and `ψ` a nontrivial additive character of `F`.  The **cuspidal virtual character**

`TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter F E hE θ ψ
  = χ(Ind_{Z U}^{GL₂(F)} (θ|_{Fˣ} ⊗ ψ)) - χ(Ind_{Eˣ}^{GL₂(F)} θ)`

is the difference of the two induced characters computed in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/GL2/ScalarUnipotentInduction.lean` and
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/GL2/EllipticInduction.lean`.  The subtracted degrees
are `[GL₂(F) : Z U] = q² - 1` and `[GL₂(F) : Eˣ] = q (q - 1)`, so the difference has degree `q - 1`,
and its four values on the conjugacy classes of `GL₂(F)` are

* `(q - 1) θ(a)` at the central scalar `a`;
* `0` on the split regular semisimple classes;
* `-θ(a)` at a nontrivial Jordan block with eigenvalue `a`;
* `-(θ(u) + θ(u^q))` at the elliptic class of `u : Eˣ` outside `F`.

Classically, for `θ` in general position -- that is, `θ^q ≠ θ` -- these are the character values of
the cuspidal (discrete series) representation attached to `θ`.  What is established below is that
the difference is a virtual character (`TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter_mem_virtualCharacters`)
with those four values and degree `q - 1`, together with the two symmetries the classical
parametrization rests on and the fact that the orbit `{θ, θ^q}` is the exact fibre of the
construction.  The norm computation showing that, for `θ^q ≠ θ` and `ψ` nontrivial, it is an
irreducible character is `TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter_mem_irreducibleCharacters`, in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/GL2/Cuspidal/Irreducible.lean`.

## The two symmetries

The four values do not mention `ψ`, so the difference does not depend on which nontrivial additive
character was used to build it: the `q - 1` summands of the Gelfand-Graev term at a Jordan block
are the values of `ψ` on `Fˣ`, and those sum to `-1` whatever nontrivial `ψ` is.  Nor does it
change when `θ` is replaced by `θ^q`: the `q`-power map fixes `Fˣ`, so the central and Jordan
values are unchanged, and on the elliptic classes it exchanges the two summands `θ(u)` and
`θ(u^q)`.  So the construction is constant on the orbits `{θ, θ^q}` of the `q`-power map.

Both are proved by evaluating at the four normal forms, which is enough by
`TauCeti.ClassFunction.ext_gl2NormalForm`.

## The parametrization by orbits

Classically it is that constancy in `θ` that lets the cuspidal series be indexed by the orbits
`{θ, θ^q}` rather than by the characters themselves, and the other half of such an indexing is
that *distinct* orbits give distinct virtual characters.  That half is proved here, so the orbit
is exactly the fibre of the construction: the four values determine `u ↦ θ(u) + θ(u^q)` on all of
`Eˣ` -- on the elliptic classes directly, and on the units coming from `Fˣ` because there the
`q`-power map is the identity and the central value `(q - 1) θ(a)` recovers `θ(a)` -- and a sum of
two characters of `Eˣ` determines the unordered pair of its summands, distinct characters being
linearly independent over `ℂ`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter`: the difference of the two induced characters.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter_def` and `TauCeti.coe_GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter`: the
  defining equation, as class functions and as functions on `GL₂(F)`.
* `TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter_apply_scalar`,
  `TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter_apply_diagGL`,
  `TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter_apply_jordanGL` and
  `TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter_apply_gl2NonSplitTorusHom`: **the four values**.
* `TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter_apply_one`: **the degree is `q - 1`**.
* `TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter_mem_virtualCharacters`: the difference is a virtual
  character.
* `TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter_eq_of_addChar_ne_one` and
  `TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter_comp_powMonoidHom`: **the two symmetries**, in `ψ` and in
  `θ`.
* `TauCeti.apply_add_apply_pow_card_eq_of_GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter_eq`: the virtual character
  determines `u ↦ θ(u) + θ(u^q)` on all of `Eˣ`.
* `TauCeti.eq_or_eq_comp_powMonoidHom_of_GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter_eq`: **distinct orbits give
  distinct virtual characters**.
* `TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter_eq_iff`: **the orbit `{θ, θ^q}` is the exact fibre of the
  construction**, the two symmetries and the previous item together.

## Implementation notes

The four values and the degree are `simp` lemmas, as the character values of the two inductions
(`TauCeti.character_GL2ScalarUnipotentInduction_scalar`,
`TauCeti.character_GL2EllipticInduction_scalar` and their siblings) are; the defining equations
`TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter_def`, `TauCeti.coe_GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter` and
`TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter_apply` are not, since rewriting with them would undo the
values.
