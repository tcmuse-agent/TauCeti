# Induction from the scalar--unipotent subgroup of `GL₂(𝔽_q)`

Let `F` be a finite field with `q` elements and let `Z U = TauCeti.GL2ScalarUnipotent F` be the
product of the centre of `GL₂(F)` with the unipotent radical of the Borel subgroup: the matrices
`!![x, y; 0, x]`, a copy of `Fˣ × (F, +)`.  This file computes the induced class function
`TauCeti.indClassFun (GL2ScalarUnipotent F) f` on the four families of conjugacy classes of
`GL₂(F)`: at a central scalar `a` it is `[GL₂(F) : Z U] = q² - 1` copies of `f(a)`, it vanishes on
the split semisimple and the elliptic families, and at a non-semisimple element with repeated
eigenvalue `a` it is the sum of `f` over the `q - 1` Jordan blocks `!![a, c; 0, a]` with `c ≠ 0`.

It then specialises those four values to the inducing datum that the character table needs.  A
multiplicative character `μ : Fˣ → ℂˣ` and an additive character `ψ : F → ℂ` define the linear
character

`(a, t) ↦ μ(a) ψ(t)`

under the isomorphism `Fˣ × (F, +) ≃ Z U`; this file constructs that character, the line it acts
on, and the representation the line induces to `GL₂(F)`, and reads its degree and its four
character values off the class-function computation:

* `(q² - 1) μ(a)` on the scalar matrix `a I`;
* `0` on split regular semisimple and on elliptic elements;
* `-μ(a)` on a nontrivial Jordan block with eigenvalue `a`, once `ψ` is nontrivial.

Together with `TauCeti.GL2EllipticInduction`, the representation induced from the non-split
torus, this supplies the two induced characters whose difference is the cuspidal virtual character
`TauCeti.GL2CuspidalVirtualCharacter` of `GL₂(𝔽_q)`, taken in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/GL2/Cuspidal/Basic.lean`.  The Gelfand-Graev summand
here is the one that carries the degree, since
`[GL₂(F) : Z U] - [GL₂(F) : Eˣ] = (q² - 1) - q (q - 1) = q - 1`.

## The geometry behind the four values

Everything follows from which conjugates of an element land in `Z U`, and an element of `Z U`
differs from a scalar by a square-zero matrix: subtracting its repeated diagonal entry leaves a
nilpotent.  That condition is invariant under conjugation, and it is exactly what an element with
two distinct eigenvalues -- split or elliptic -- fails.

* A **scalar** matrix is central, so every conjugate of it lies in `Z U`, and the sum has one
  equal summand for each of the `[GL₂(F) : Z U]` cosets.
* A **split semisimple** element `diag (a, b)` with `a ≠ b` fails the square-zero condition,
  because `(a - u)² = (b - u)² = 0` would force `a = u = b`; an **elliptic** element, the matrix
  of multiplication by `x` outside `F` in a quadratic extension `E/F`, fails it because `E` is a
  field, so `(x - u)² = 0` would force `x = u ∈ F`.  No conjugate of either meets `Z U`.
* A **non-semisimple** element `!![a, b; 0, a]` with `b ≠ 0` is conjugated into `Z U` by exactly
  the upper triangular matrices, and those form the `q - 1` cosets of `Z U` represented by the
  diagonal matrices `diag (c, 1)`, `c : Fˣ`.  Conjugating by `diag (c, 1)` rescales the
  off-diagonal entry to `c⁻¹ b`, so the `q - 1` summands run over all the Jordan blocks with the
  same diagonal entry.

Neither the square-zero argument nor the coset count needs separability or a case split on the
characteristic, unlike the trace-and-determinant route, which in characteristic two only sees the
trace.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GL2ScalarUnipotent.linearChar`: the character `(a, t) ↦ μ(a) ψ(t)` of `Z U`.
* `TauCeti.GL2ScalarUnipotentRep`: its one-dimensional complex representation.
* `TauCeti.GL2ScalarUnipotentInduction`: the representation induced from `Z U` to `GL₂(F)`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GL2ScalarUnipotent.indClassFun_eq_zero_of_forall_sq_ne_zero`: the induced class
  function vanishes at an element that differs from no scalar by a square-zero matrix.
* `TauCeti.GL2ScalarUnipotent.mem_classFunction`: every function on the abelian subgroup `Z U` is
  a class function, so the summands depend only on the coset of their representative.
* `TauCeti.GL2ScalarUnipotent.indClassFun_scalar`,
  `TauCeti.GL2ScalarUnipotent.indClassFun_diagGL`,
  `TauCeti.GL2ScalarUnipotent.indClassFun_gl2NonSplitTorusHom` and
  `TauCeti.GL2ScalarUnipotent.indClassFun_jordanGL`: **the four values**, on the central, split
  semisimple, elliptic and non-semisimple normal forms.
* `TauCeti.finrank_GL2ScalarUnipotentInduction`: the induced representation has dimension
  `q² - 1`.
* `TauCeti.character_GL2ScalarUnipotentInduction_scalar`,
  `TauCeti.character_GL2ScalarUnipotentInduction_diagGL`,
  `TauCeti.character_GL2ScalarUnipotentInduction_gl2NonSplitTorusHom` and
  `TauCeti.character_GL2ScalarUnipotentInduction_jordanGL`: its four character values.

That the four normal forms exhaust the conjugacy classes is
`TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.ConjugacyClasses`; as in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/GL2/PrincipalSeries/CharacterValues.lean`, the values
below are stated at the normal forms themselves rather than assembled into a single case
distinction.  Each of the four class-function values is a `simp` lemma, as are the four character
values it specialises to: the left-hand side is `indClassFun` (respectively the character) at one
of the normal forms, and the right-hand side is the closed form it reduces to.
