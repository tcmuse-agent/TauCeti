# The character table of a finite group

Let `G` be a finite group and `k` an algebraically closed field in which `|G|` is invertible. The
characters of the irreducible representations of `G` over `k` form a finite set
`TauCeti.irreducibleCharacters k G` of functions `G → k`, of size the number of conjugacy classes of
`G`: they are linearly independent, they span the class functions, and every irreducible
representation is equivalent to one that occurs in the complete family produced by the Wedderburn
decomposition of `k[G]`.

Choosing an enumeration of that set by `Fin r`, `r = |ConjClasses G|`, turns the irreducible
characters into the rows of a **square matrix**, the character table
`TauCeti.characterTable k G : Matrix (Fin r) (ConjClasses G) k`, whose `(i, C)` entry is the value
of the `i`-th irreducible character on the class `C`. Its columns are labelled by the actual
conjugacy classes of `G`; only the rows depend on the enumeration, and any two enumerations differ
by a permutation of them.

The two orthogonality relations become statements about the table: its rows are orthonormal for the
character pairing, and its columns are orthogonal with the class sizes as weights. Over `ℂ` both
take their familiar Hermitian form, because inversion conjugates character values
(`TauCeti.Representation.conj_char`).

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.irreducibleCharacters`: the set of irreducible characters of `G` over `k`.
* `TauCeti.irreducibleCharacter`: the `i`-th irreducible character, for an enumeration of that set
  by `Fin (Nat.card (ConjClasses G))`, together with `TauCeti.irreducibleRepresentation`, an
  irreducible representation affording it, and `TauCeti.characterDegree`, its degree.
* `TauCeti.characterTable`: the character table of `G`.
* `TauCeti.basisIrreducibleCharacter`: its rows, as a basis of the class functions, so that
  `TauCeti.linearIndependent_irreducibleCharacter` holds in `G → k`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.card_irreducibleCharacters`: **`G` has as many irreducible characters as conjugacy
  classes**, so the table is square; `TauCeti.character_mem_irreducibleCharacters` is the statement
  that no irreducible character is missing from it.
* `TauCeti.characterTable_apply`: the entries of the table are the irreducible character values.
* `TauCeti.card_inv_mul_sum_characterTable_mul_characterTable_inv` and
  `TauCeti.card_inv_mul_sum_characterTable_mul_conj`: **first (row) orthogonality**, over `k` and in
  its Hermitian form over `ℂ`; `TauCeti.card_inv_mul_sum_card_conjClass_mul_characterTable_mul_conj`
  is the latter summed one column at a time, the form in which the roadmap's specification of a
  character table asks for it;
  `TauCeti.characterPairing_ofCharacter_irreducibleRepresentation_orthonormal` is the same relation
  phrased as orthonormality for the character pairing.
* `TauCeti.exists_irreducibleCharacter_eq_one`: the trivial character is a row of the table, and
  in characteristic zero every other row is nonconstant
  (`TauCeti.exists_irreducibleCharacter_ne_characterDegree`).
* `TauCeti.card_conjClass_mul_sum_characterTable_mul_characterTable_inv` and
  `TauCeti.sum_characterTable_mul_conj`: **second (column) orthogonality**, over `k` and in its
  Hermitian form over `ℂ`.
* `TauCeti.irreducibleCharacter_apply_mem_of_forall_pow_eq_one_mem`: the entries lie in every
  subring containing the `|G|`-th roots of unity.
* `TauCeti.characterTable_one`: the identity-class column of the table lists the degrees, which are
  positive (`TauCeti.characterDegree_pos`) and have squares summing to `|G|`
  (`TauCeti.sum_characterDegree_sq_eq_card`); in characteristic zero they moreover divide `|G|`
  (`TauCeti.characterDegree_dvd_card`).

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.irreducibleCharacters` is defined by the representations on the coordinate spaces
`Fin n → k`, the shape in which the Wedderburn blocks of `k[G]` produce them; this also keeps the
set free of a universe parameter beyond those of `k` and `G`. Nothing is lost:
`TauCeti.character_mem_irreducibleCharacters` puts the character of an irreducible representation on
*any* finite-dimensional space in the set, since it is equivalent to one of the coordinate ones.

The rows are indexed by `Fin (Nat.card (ConjClasses G))` rather than by a bare `Fin r`, so that the
squareness of the table is visible in its type.

The roadmap pins the character table over `ℂ`. Everything holds over any algebraically closed field
in which `|G|` is invertible except the Hermitian refinements, which are stated over `ℂ`, and the
divisibility of the degrees by `|G|`, which additionally assumes `CharZero k`. So the table is
defined over such a `k`, and `TauCeti.characterTable ℂ G` is the pinned object.

This is not a `simp` lemma: `TauCeti.characterTable_apply` already rewrites the left-hand side to
`(starRingEnd ℂ) (TauCeti.irreducibleCharacter ℂ i g)`, which `TauCeti.conj_irreducibleCharacter`
then normalizes. -/

/-- **First (row) orthogonality over `ℂ`, summed one column at a time**: the Hermitian pairing of
two rows of the complex character table, collected over the conjugacy classes with the class sizes
as weights. This is the shape in which the roadmap's specification of a character table asks for row
orthonormality; `TauCeti.card_inv_mul_sum_characterTable_mul_conj` is the same statement summed over
the group.

The enumeration of the conjugacy classes is an explicit `Fintype` argument rather than a classical
one, so that the statement is about whichever enumeration the caller has in hand; a caller with
`[DecidableEq G]` has one, and a classical instance would not be defeq to it. -/
