# The genus-one Heegaard diagram of `S¹ × S²`

On the torus `ℝ² / ℤ²` let `α` be the circle `y = 0` and let `β` be the circle
`y = ε sin (2π x)` for a small `ε > 0`, both oriented by increasing `x`. Two isotopic
attaching circles on a torus give `S¹ × S²`; the perturbation makes them meet transversally in
the two points `p₀ = (0, 0)` and `p₁ = (1/2, 0)`. The complement of `α ∪ β` has three regions:
the bigon `B₁` between `α` and `β` over `0 < x < 1/2`, where `β` lies above `α`; the bigon `B₂`
over `1/2 < x < 1`, where `β` lies below `α`; and the annulus `A` making up the rest of the torus.

In `TauCeti.HeegaardRegionSystem.circleTimesSphere r` the points `p₀`, `p₁` are `0, 1 : Fin 2`,
the regions `A`, `B₁`, `B₂` are `0, 1, 2 : Fin 3`, and the single basepoint lies in the region
`r`. Both bigons are domains from the generator `p₀` to the generator `p₁`, so their difference
`B₁ - B₂`, whose boundary is `α - β`, is a periodic domain whenever the basepoint lies in `A`.

This is a basic example of a diagram with a nonzero periodic domain, on which weak admissibility
depends on the placement of the basepoint. With the basepoint in the annulus, the periodic
domains are the multiples of `B₁ - B₂`, and the diagram is weakly admissible. With the basepoint
in a bigon, say `B₁`, the periodic domain `A + 2 B₂` has no negative coefficient, so the diagram
is not weakly admissible.

The regions have Euler characteristics `χ(A) = 0` and `χ(B₁) = χ(B₂) = 1`; the annulus has four
corners and each bigon has two. With these, the combinatorial Maslov index of each bigon is `1`,
as for the domain of a holomorphic bigon, and that of the periodic domain `B₁ - B₂` is `0`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.HeegaardRegionSystem.circleTimesSphere`: the diagram, with its basepoint in a given
  region.
* `TauCeti.HeegaardRegionSystem.circleTimesSphereGenerator`: its two generators.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.HeegaardRegionSystem.isDomainBetween_circleTimesSphere_single_one` and
  `TauCeti.HeegaardRegionSystem.isDomainBetween_circleTimesSphere_single_two`: both bigons are
  domains from `p₀` to `p₁`.
* `TauCeti.HeegaardRegionSystem.mem_periodicDomains_circleTimesSphere_iff`: periodic-domain
  membership for any basepoint placement.
* `TauCeti.HeegaardRegionSystem.periodicDomains_circleTimesSphere_zero`: with the basepoint in
  the annulus, the periodic domains are the multiples of `B₁ - B₂`.
* `TauCeti.HeegaardRegionSystem.weaklyAdmissible_circleTimesSphere_iff`: the diagram is weakly
  admissible exactly when its basepoint lies in the annulus.
* `TauCeti.HeegaardRegionSystem.not_weaklyAdmissible_circleTimesSphere_one`: with the basepoint
  in a bigon, the diagram is not weakly admissible.
* `TauCeti.HeegaardRegionSystem.maslovIndex_circleTimesSphere_single_one`,
  `TauCeti.HeegaardRegionSystem.maslovIndex_circleTimesSphere_single_two` and
  `TauCeti.HeegaardRegionSystem.maslovIndex_circleTimesSphere_periodic`: both bigons have Maslov
  index one and the periodic domain has Maslov index zero.
