# The sheaf of holomorphic functions on `ℂ`, and its étalé space

Analytic continuation transports *germs*. `Conformal/Continuation/Basic.lean` carries them
concretely — as families of functions compared by `=ᶠ[𝓝 _]` — and records, without proof, that
reading a germ as a point of the **étalé space of holomorphic germs** turns a continuation along a
path into a continuous lift of that path. Neither Mathlib nor this repository had the space that
sentence names. This file builds it, and proves the two facts that make it the right object: the
projection to the base is a local homeomorphism, and it is a **separated map**.

## What is built

The sheaf itself comes from Mathlib's local-predicate machinery
(`Mathlib/Topology/Sheaves/LocalPredicate.lean`): `TauCeti.IsHolomorphicSection` says that a
function on an open `U ⊆ ℂ` is the restriction of a function analytic on a neighbourhood of every
point of `U`, this is stable under restriction and local, and `TauCeti.holomorphicPresheaf` /
`TauCeti.holomorphicSheaf` are the presheaf and the sheaf of such sections, the latter being
Mathlib's `TopCat.subsheafToTypes` at that local predicate. Locality is where the extension by
zero of a section enters: a function given only on `U` has no values elsewhere to be analytic at,
so the witness glued from local ones is `Function.extend Subtype.val`, which agrees with the
section on `U` and is analytic there because analyticity is a local property of an open set. The
same extension names the function underlying a section,
`TauCeti.HolomorphicPresheaf.sectionFun`, and every statement below is phrased against it rather
than against the subtype.

The étalé space is Mathlib's `TopCat.Presheaf.EtaleSpace` — pairs of a base point and a germ over
it — with the chart API of `TauCeti/Topology/Sheaves/EtaleSpace.lean`. On top of it this file adds
the dictionary between germs as stalk elements and germs as eventual equality of functions:

* `TauCeti.HolomorphicPresheaf.germ_eq_iff` — two sections have the same germ at `x` exactly when
  their functions agree near `x`;
* `TauCeti.HolomorphicPresheaf.germAt` — the stalk element carried by a function analytic at a
  point, and `TauCeti.HolomorphicPresheaf.germPoint` the corresponding point of the étalé space;
* `TauCeti.HolomorphicPresheaf.germAt_eq_iff` — that dictionary again, now between two functions
  rather than two sections;
* `TauCeti.HolomorphicPresheaf.repFun` — a holomorphic representative of the germ carried by a
  point of the étalé space, inverse to `germPoint` by
  `TauCeti.HolomorphicPresheaf.germPoint_repFun`.

`germAt` is total: a function that is not analytic at the point in question is sent to the germ of
`0`. The junk value is never inspected — every lemma about `germAt` either supplies analyticity or
is insensitive to it (`TauCeti.HolomorphicPresheaf.germAt_congr` holds for arbitrary functions,
both sides being junk when the common germ is not analytic) — and totality is what lets the germ
map of a family be written as a plain function of the parameter, with no proof argument to
transport.

## The two theorems

`TauCeti.TopCat.Presheaf.EtaleSpace.isLocalHomeomorph_base` is the chart statement of
`TauCeti/Topology/Sheaves/EtaleSpace.lean`: over an open set on which a section is defined, the
germs of that section form an open set carried homeomorphically onto the base.

`TauCeti.HolomorphicPresheaf.isSeparatedMap_base` is the analytic content, and it is the
**identity theorem** in disguise. Two distinct germs at one point `x` are represented by sections
over two open sets; restrict both to one disc about `x`. The two open sets of germs they sweep out
are disjoint, for a point of both would be a point `y` of the disc at which the two
representatives have the same germ, and the identity theorem on the disc — connected, and where
both representatives are analytic — would propagate that agreement from `y` back to `x`, making
the two germs equal. Separatedness is exactly the hypothesis Mathlib's abstract monodromy theorem
`IsLocalHomeomorph.monodromy_theorem` asks for, and its docstring names analytic continuation as
the intended application; `Conformal/Continuation/Etale.lean` supplies the continuation/lift
correspondence needed to apply it.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.holomorphicSheaf` — the sheaf of holomorphic functions on `ℂ`.
* `TauCeti.HolomorphicPresheaf.germ_eq_iff` — germs agree exactly when the functions agree nearby.
* `TauCeti.HolomorphicPresheaf.continuousOn_germPoint` — the germ map of a holomorphic function is
  a continuous section of the étalé projection.
* `TauCeti.HolomorphicPresheaf.isSeparatedMap_base` — **the étalé projection is separated**.

## Generality

The *target* is an arbitrary complex Banach space `E`, the generality at which
`Conformal/Continuation/Basic.lean` states analytic continuation; the scalar case `E = ℂ` is the
one the conformal-mapping consumers instantiate. Both restrictions on `E` are inherited rather
than chosen. It is confined to `Type` rather than `Type*` by Mathlib's étalé space, which is built
for a `C`-valued presheaf on `X : TopCat.{v}` with `[Category.{v} C]`: the base `TopCat.of ℂ`
lives in `TopCat.{0}`, so the values of the presheaf are forced into `Type`. Completeness is asked
for exactly where Mathlib asks for it, from `TauCeti.HolomorphicPresheaf.germAt` on, because
`AnalyticAt.exists_ball_analyticOnNhd` — which names a disc on which a germ has a representative —
is stated for a Banach target. The sheaf, the germ dictionary
`TauCeti.HolomorphicPresheaf.germ_eq_iff` and both theorems about the projection are free of it,
the identity theorem `AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq` needing no
completeness.

The *source* is `ℂ` rather than a Riemann surface, in accordance with the generality bar of
`ConformalMapping/README.md`, which fixes the scalar domain for the conformal layers L0–L6, and
because the consumer `Conformal/Continuation/Basic.lean` continues germs along paths in `ℂ`. A
Riemann surface source would need a holomorphic atlas to even state the predicate, which the
pinned Mathlib has for complex manifolds but which this area does not use anywhere else.

## Relation to Mathlib

Mathlib has the étalé space of a presheaf (`Mathlib/Topology/Sheaves/EtaleSpace.lean`) and the
local-predicate construction of a sheaf of functions
(`Mathlib/Topology/Sheaves/LocalPredicate.lean`), both consumed here; it has no sheaf of
holomorphic functions and no étalé space of holomorphic germs. The in-progress human-curated
Riemann-mapping effort [mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505)
contains no continuation or monodromy material, so nothing here is a shim for it. Mathlib's sheaf
of smooth functions on a manifold (`Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/Sheaf/Smooth.lean`) reaches the same
`LocalPredicate` interface through the structure-groupoid machinery, but is fixed at smoothness
`∞`; running that route at analytic smoothness would put the charted-space structure of `ℂ` and a
translation between `ContMDiff` and `AnalyticOnNhd` between this file and the identity theorem it
needs, so the predicate is written out directly instead.
