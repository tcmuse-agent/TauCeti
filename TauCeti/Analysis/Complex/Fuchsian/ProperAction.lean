# Properly discontinuous actions of Fuchsian groups

Every discrete subgroup of `PSL(2, ℝ)` acts properly discontinuously on the upper half-plane,
as a consequence of the proper projective action constructed in
`TauCeti.Analysis.Complex.UpperHalfPlane.ProperAction`.

This supplies the proper-discontinuity input needed to construct Hausdorff orbit quotients and
to control stabilizers of Fuchsian groups.
