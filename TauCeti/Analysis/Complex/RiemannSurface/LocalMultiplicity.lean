# The local multiplicity of a holomorphic map between Riemann surfaces

Let `f : X → Y` be a map between Riemann surfaces, that is, complex manifolds modelled on `ℂ`, and
let `x : X`. Reading `f` in a chart `e` at `x` and a chart `e'` at `f x` gives the function
`e' ∘ f ∘ e.symm` of one complex variable, and the *local multiplicity* of `f` at `x` is the
order of vanishing of `e' ∘ f ∘ e.symm - e' (f x)` at `e x`, computed with Mathlib's
`analyticOrderNatAt`. This file defines `TauCeti.RiemannSurface.localMultiplicity` using the
preferred charts `chartAt ℂ x` and `chartAt ℂ (f x)`, and proves that any two charts of the
maximal atlases give the same value when `f` is holomorphic near `x`
(`TauCeti.RiemannSurface.localMultiplicity_eq_analyticOrderNatAt`). Chart independence makes the
local multiplicity an invariant of the map rather than of the coordinates used to read it, so it
may be computed in whichever charts are convenient; every result below is obtained by choosing
suitable charts.

For a map holomorphic near `x`, the local multiplicity vanishes exactly when `f` is constant
near `x`, and otherwise it is positive; it multiplies under composition; and it equals `1`
exactly when `f` is injective on a neighbourhood of `x`, so that a holomorphic map is a local
biholomorphism precisely at its points of multiplicity one. On the model space `ℂ` the local
multiplicity is the order of vanishing of `f - f z` at `z`, and the power map `z ↦ z ^ m` has
local multiplicity `m` at the origin.

For a map holomorphic and nonconstant near `x`, the local multiplicity `m ≥ 1` is the
ramification index of the map at `x`: near such a point the map is `z ↦ z ^ m` in suitable
coordinates, and the degree of a nonconstant holomorphic map between compact connected Riemann
surfaces is the sum of the local multiplicities over any fibre. Neither the local normal form nor
the degree is part of this file.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.RiemannSurface.localMultiplicity`: the local multiplicity of `f : X → Y` at `x`.
* `TauCeti.RiemannSurface.localMultiplicity_eq_analyticOrderNatAt`: it may be computed in any
  charts of the maximal atlases at `x` and `f x`.
* `TauCeti.RiemannSurface.localMultiplicity_eq_zero_iff` and
  `TauCeti.RiemannSurface.localMultiplicity_pos_iff`: it vanishes exactly at points near which
  `f` is constant; in particular a constant map has local multiplicity `0`
  (`TauCeti.RiemannSurface.localMultiplicity_const`).
* `TauCeti.RiemannSurface.localMultiplicity_comp`: it multiplies under composition.
* `TauCeti.RiemannSurface.localMultiplicity_eq_one_iff`: it is `1` exactly when `f` is
  injective near `x`.
* `TauCeti.RiemannSurface.localMultiplicity_pow_zero`: the power map `z ↦ z ^ m` has local
  multiplicity `m` at `0`.

/-! ### The local multiplicity -/

/-- The **local multiplicity** of a map `f : X → Y` between Riemann surfaces at `x`: the order of
vanishing at `chartAt ℂ x x` of `f` read in the charts at `x` and `f x`, recentred at `f x`.

For `f` holomorphic near `x` this does not depend on the charts
(`TauCeti.RiemannSurface.localMultiplicity_eq_analyticOrderNatAt`) and vanishes exactly when `f`
is constant near `x` (`TauCeti.RiemannSurface.localMultiplicity_eq_zero_iff`). If `f` is not
holomorphic near `x`, the value is junk, as for `analyticOrderNatAt`. -/
