# An image crosscut of finite length ends in two points

`Conformal/Crosscut/Image.lean` identifies the boundary piece a circular crosscut clings to as the
union of the *cluster sets* of the map at the crosscut's two endpoints, and shows each of them to be
a continuum. Nothing there says those continua are single points; in its own words, the
identification is "with a union of cluster sets, not with a connected subset of `∂Ω` running
between them". This file supplies the missing degeneration, from the one hypothesis that the
length–area method already produces: **an image crosscut of finite length has an honest limit at
each of its two ends**, so its closure is the crosscut together with two points.

That this can be had at all, and without circularity, is the point. The end of an image crosscut is
a boundary cluster set, and the boundary cluster sets of the map on the *disc* degenerating to
points is exactly the layer-**L5** milestone of `TauCetiRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md` still
open. The ends here degenerate for a different and much cheaper reason: the arc `ball c r ∩ sphere
ζ ρ` is one-dimensional, and the length of its image is a *finite* number, so the images of its
angles satisfy a Cauchy criterion as the angle runs to an end of the arc. No boundary behaviour of
the map on the disc is used, and none is proved.

## The estimate

The engine is the chord bound of `Conformal/LengthArea.lean` in its primitive, set-free form
`TauCeti.ofReal_dist_le_mul_lintegral_Ioc`: the images of the endpoints of an arc of angles are at
distance at most `|ρ|` times the angular integral of `‖deriv f‖` over *that* arc. Applied to a
sub-arc, it says that the oscillation of `f` along a piece of the circle is controlled by the length
carried by that piece alone — in the vocabulary of
`TauCeti/MeasureTheory/Integral/DominatedIncrement.lean`, that the increments of
`f ∘ circleMap ζ ρ` are *dominated* by the angular length density
`θ ↦ |ρ| * ‖deriv f (circleMap ζ ρ θ)‖ₑ`. Neither of the two conclusions drawn from that
domination sees the circle: a map on an order-connected subset of `ℝ` whose increments are
dominated by a density of finite total integral has bounded image and is uniformly continuous, the
latter by absolute continuity of the integral. Both are proved there, at that generality, and the
two statements below are their instances at the arc —
`TauCeti.exists_pos_forall_dist_le_of_lintegral_ne_top`, a modulus of continuity for `f` along the
arc in the angular parameter, and
`TauCeti.isBounded_image_circleMap_image_Ioo_of_lintegral_ne_top`.

Turning the angular modulus into a statement about the plane needs the chord formula
`TauCeti.dist_circleMap_eq_two_mul_sin_abs`: on an arc of angular width below a full turn the chord
`2 * |ρ| * sin (|θ - θ'| / 2)` stays away from zero as long as the angular gap does, so points of
the arc close in the plane are close in angle — this and nothing more is what the arc not wrapping
around the circle buys. With that, `TauCeti.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_circleMap_image_Ioo` reads the
modulus as the Cauchy criterion `TauCeti.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_of_forall_exists` of
`Topology/ClusterSet.lean` and concludes at *every* point of the closed arc, its two endpoints
included.

The same chord bound, applied with the whole arc rather than a sub-arc, bounds the image
(`TauCeti.isBounded_image_circleMap_image_Ioo_of_lintegral_ne_top`), which is what turns that
subsingleton cluster set into an honest limit:
`TauCeti.exists_tendsto_nhdsWithin_circleMap_image_Ioo`, with cluster-set form
`TauCeti.exists_clusterSetOn_circleMap_image_Ioo_eq_singleton`. All of this is about an arc of
angles and asks nothing of a crosscut.

## The crosscut

The crosscut statements are those arc statements at the arc description of
`Conformal/Crosscut/Endpoints.lean`:
`ball c r ∩ sphere ζ ρ` is the open arc of angles within `arccos (ρ / (2 * r))` of `arg (c - ζ)`,
and `closedBall c r ∩ sphere ζ ρ` is the closed one, of angular width `2 * arccos (ρ / (2 * r))`,
which is below `π` — and so, with room to spare, below the full turn the arc statements ask for —
exactly because `ρ` is positive. Finiteness of the angular integral over the arc
is finiteness of `TauCeti.circleImageLength f (ball c r) ζ ρ`, the quantity Wolff's lemma makes
small: a crosscut short enough for the length–area estimates is in particular of finite length, so
the hypothesis costs a consumer nothing it has not already paid for.

The conclusion, `TauCeti.exists_closure_image_ball_inter_sphere_eq_insert`, is that the closure of
the image crosscut is the image crosscut together with two points. Which two points, and whether
they are distinct, is not addressed: an image crosscut may well close up. What the L5 argument needs
is only that the two ends are points on `∂Ω`, so that the small arc of a locally connected `∂Ω`
joining them can be named.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_pos_forall_dist_le_of_lintegral_ne_top` — a modulus of continuity along an arc of
  finite image length, in the angular parameter.
* `TauCeti.isBounded_image_circleMap_image_Ioo_of_lintegral_ne_top` — an arc of finite image length
  has bounded image.
* `TauCeti.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_circleMap_image_Ioo` — at every point of an arc of angular
  width below a full turn and of finite image length, the cluster set of the map along the arc has
  at most one element.
* `TauCeti.exists_tendsto_nhdsWithin_circleMap_image_Ioo` and
  `TauCeti.exists_clusterSetOn_circleMap_image_Ioo_eq_singleton` — hence such an arc carries a limit
  at each point of its closure, its two endpoints included, and its cluster set there is a single
  point.
* `TauCeti.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_ball_inter_sphere`,
  `TauCeti.exists_tendsto_nhdsWithin_ball_inter_sphere` and
  `TauCeti.exists_clusterSetOn_ball_inter_sphere_eq_singleton` — the three arc statements at the arc
  of a circular crosscut, the last of them the form `Conformal/Crosscut/Image.lean` indexes over.
* `TauCeti.exists_biUnion_clusterSetOn_ball_inter_sphere_eq_pair` — hence the union of the cluster
  sets at the two endpoints, the term `Conformal/Crosscut/Image.lean` adjoins to the image crosscut
  to close it, is a pair of points. (That file also identifies the union with the boundary piece the
  image crosscut clings to, but only for injective `f`.)
* `TauCeti.exists_closure_image_ball_inter_sphere_eq_insert` — hence the closure of an image
  crosscut of finite length is the image crosscut together with two points.

## Generality

In accordance with the generality bar of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, which fixes scalar `ℂ` for
every theorem added in layers L0–L6, everything below is stated for maps of `ℂ`. The arc statements
ask nothing of the ambient disc — only that `f` be holomorphic on an open set containing the arc —
so they apply to any circle in any domain, the crosscut being one instance; neither injectivity of
`f` nor any hypothesis on its image is used anywhere in the file. They ask nothing of the sign of
the radius either, a negative `ρ` tracing the same circle in the other sense and `ρ = 0` collapsing
the arc to the point `ζ`, where the estimates are trivial. The crosscut statements do ask
`0 < ρ < 2 * r`, which is what makes `ball c r ∩ sphere ζ ρ` a genuine crosscut.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Layer L5 is absent from
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), the in-progress
human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort, which stops at the mapping theorem itself, and the
pinned Mathlib has no boundary correspondence for conformal maps. So this file is new Lean
formalization rather than a temporary shim, and it consumes no L0–L3 shim: its analytic input is the
chord bound of `Conformal/LengthArea.lean`, which rests on the fundamental theorem of calculus along
an arc.

/-- **A modulus of continuity along an arc of finite image length.** If `f` is holomorphic on an
open set containing the piece of the circle of radius `ρ` about `ζ` cut out by the angles `Ioo a b`,
and the angular integral of `‖deriv f‖` over that arc is finite, then for every tolerance `ε > 0`
there is an angular gap `η > 0` within which the images of two angles of the arc stay `ε` apart.

The gap is uniform over the arc, and in particular does not shrink as an end of the arc is
approached: that is the whole content. A short sub-arc carries little length, and by the chord
bound `TauCeti.ofReal_dist_le_mul_lintegral_Ioc` the length a sub-arc carries bounds the distance
between the images of its two ends; that is the domination hypothesis of
`Set.OrdConnected.uniformContinuousOn_of_edist_le_setLIntegral`, which draws the modulus from the
absolute continuity of the integral and knows nothing of circles.

Uniform continuity in the angle is *not* uniform continuity of `f` on the arc as a subset of the
plane, but on an arc of angular width below a full turn the two agree, which is what
`TauCeti.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_circleMap_image_Ioo` exploits.

Nothing is assumed of the sign of the radius: a negative `ρ` traces the same circle in the other
sense, and at `ρ = 0` the circle is the single point `ζ`, where there is nothing to estimate. -/

/-! ## The cluster sets of an arc of finite image length -/

/-- **An arc of finite image length has at most one cluster value at each of its points.** For `f`
holomorphic on an open set containing the open arc `circleMap ζ ρ '' Ioo a b`, of angular width
below a full turn and of finite image length, and for any angle `θ₀` of the *closed* arc, `f` has at
most one cluster value along the arc at the point `circleMap ζ ρ θ₀`.

The two endpoints `θ₀ = a` and `θ₀ = b` are the case with content; at an interior angle the
statement is continuity. The angular width restriction is what makes closeness in the plane the same
as closeness in angle, and it is exactly the requirement that the arc not wrap around the circle: by
the chord formula `TauCeti.dist_circleMap_eq_two_mul_sin_abs` the chord is
`2 * |ρ| * sin (|θ - θ₀| / 2)`, which over the angular gaps between `m` and the width `b - a` of the
arc stays at least its value at one of those two ends, so a point of the arc within
`2 * |ρ| * min (sin (m / 2)) (sin ((b - a) / 2))` of `circleMap ζ ρ θ₀` is within `m` of `θ₀` in
angle. Feeding that to the modulus `TauCeti.exists_pos_forall_dist_le_of_lintegral_ne_top` gives the
Cauchy criterion `TauCeti.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_of_forall_exists`. A radius of either sign
traces the same circle; at `ρ = 0` the arc is the single point `ζ` and the criterion is immediate,
no angular control being needed. -/

closure.** This is `TauCeti.subsingleton_clusterSetOn_circleMap_image_Ioo` at the arc description of
`Conformal/Crosscut/Endpoints.lean`: a genuine circular crosscut is the open arc of angles within
`arccos (ρ / (2 * r))` of `arg (c - ζ)`, of angular width below `π`, and its closure adds exactly
the two angles at the ends.

The two endpoints, where `e ∈ sphere c r ∩ sphere ζ ρ`, are the case with content. Neither
injectivity of `f` nor any hypothesis on its image is used. -/

/-- **The two ends of a circular crosscut of finite image length are two points.** The union of the
cluster sets of `f` at the two endpoints of the crosscut is a pair. That union is the term
`Conformal/Crosscut/Image.lean` adjoins to the image crosscut to write
`closure (f '' (ball c r ∩ sphere ζ ρ))`, under exactly the hypotheses assumed here; that
decomposition is a union, not a disjoint one, so nothing here says the pair misses the image
crosscut. The other description of the union in that file, as the piece of
`frontier (f '' ball c r)` the image crosscut clings to, is *not* available here: it asks `f` to be
injective on `ball c r`, which makes `f '' ball c r` open and hence disjoint from its own
frontier. Adding that hypothesis is
`TauCeti.exists_frontier_inter_closure_image_ball_inter_sphere_eq_pair` of
`Conformal/Crosscut/BoundaryEnds.lean`.

Nothing is claimed about the two points: they may coincide, an image crosscut being free to close
up. What a boundary-correspondence argument needs of them is that they are points at all, so that
the arc of a locally connected image boundary joining them can be named. -/

Which two points they are is not recorded here; the sharper statement that they are exactly the
points where the closed image crosscut meets `frontier (f '' ball c r)` is
`TauCeti.exists_frontier_inter_closure_image_ball_inter_sphere_eq_pair` in
