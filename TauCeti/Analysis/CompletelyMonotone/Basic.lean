# Completely monotone functions

A function `f : ℝ → ℝ` is *completely monotone on a set* if its reflection `u ↦ f (-u)` is
absolutely monotone on the reflected set. Mathlib formulates absolute monotonicity through a
Taylor-series witness, so this remains meaningful on sets that are not uniquely differentiable.
On a `UniqueDiffOn` set it is equivalent to smoothness together with alternating signs for the
iterated derivatives within the set. The principal specialization in this development uses the
closed half-line `[0, ∞)`:
`(-1)ⁿ f⁽ⁿ⁾(t) ≥ 0` for every `n` and every `t ≥ 0`. Equivalently `f` is nonnegative,
nonincreasing, convex, and so on through every order. Bernstein's theorem identifies the
completely monotone functions on the *open* half-line `(0, ∞)` with the Laplace transforms of
positive measures on `[0, ∞)`. Demanding smoothness up to the boundary point `0`, as we do
here, is a genuine strengthening: it carves out the subclass whose representing measure has
every moment finite. (It thereby excludes some Laplace transforms of finite measures, such as
`t ↦ ∫₀^∞ e^{-x t} (1 + x)⁻² dx`, which is finite at `0` yet has `f'(0⁺) = -∞`.) The
prototypes `t ↦ e^{-x t}` (`x ≥ 0`) are the extreme rays out of which Bernstein's theorem
builds the general member.

The smoothness clause is essential and is not folded into the sign condition: an iterated
derivative defaults to a junk value where the function fails to be differentiable, so
without it a badly behaved `f` could satisfy `0 ≤ 0` vacuously. We phrase the sign condition
through `iteratedDerivWithin _ (Set.Ici 0)`, the derivative *within* the closed half-line,
which is the object that pairs cleanly with `ContDiffOn` (in particular at the boundary
point `0`); on the open half-line it agrees with the ordinary iterated derivative.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.CompletelyMonotoneOn`: complete monotonicity on an arbitrary set, defined by reflecting
  Mathlib's `AbsolutelyMonotoneOn` predicate.
* `TauCeti.CompletelyMonotoneOn.iff_neg_one_pow_mul_iteratedDerivWithin_nonneg`: on a
  `UniqueDiffOn` set, equivalence with smoothness and alternating signs.
* `TauCeti.CompletelyMonotoneOn.of_contDiff`: a globally smooth function whose ordinary iterated
  derivatives have alternating signs on a set is completely monotone there.
* `TauCeti.CompletelyMonotoneOn.add`, `TauCeti.CompletelyMonotoneOn.smul`: closure under addition
  and nonnegative scalar multiplication.
* `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone`: the predicate that `f` is smooth and sign-alternating on
  `[0, ∞)`.
* `TauCeti.isCompletelyMonotone_iff_completelyMonotoneOn`: `IsCompletelyMonotone` is the
  `Ici 0` specialization of `CompletelyMonotoneOn`.
* `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone.congr`: complete monotonicity only depends on the values of the
  function on `[0, ∞)`.
* `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone.nonneg`, `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone.derivWithin_nonpos`,
  `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone.antitoneOn`: a completely monotone function is nonnegative
  and nonincreasing on `[0, ∞)`.
* `TauCeti.IsContinuousCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi.exists_nonneg_tendsto_atTop`,
  `TauCeti.IsContinuousCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi.le_of_tendsto_atTop`: order-limit consequences of
  nonnegativity and monotonicity on `[0, ∞)`.
* `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone.neg_one_pow_mul_iteratedDeriv_nonneg`: on the open half-line,
  the sign condition also holds for ordinary iterated derivatives.
* `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone.add`, `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone.sum`,
  `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone.smul`: closure under addition, finite sums, and nonnegative
  scalar multiples.
* `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi`: the open-half-line analogue, using ordinary iterated
  derivatives on `(0, ∞)`.
* `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi.convexOn`: a completely monotone function on `(0, ∞)` is
  convex there.
* `TauCeti.isCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi_of_forall_comp_add_const`: complete monotonicity on
  `(0, ∞)` can be checked on the positive translates of a function, the converse of
  `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi.isCompletelyMonotone_comp_add_const`.
* `TauCeti.IsContinuousCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi`: the closed-half-line predicate used by the
  finite-measure Hausdorff--Bernstein--Widder theorem: continuity on `[0, ∞)` plus complete
  monotonicity on `(0, ∞)`.
* `TauCeti.isCompletelyMonotone_const`: a nonnegative constant is completely monotone.
* `TauCeti.isCompletelyMonotone_exp_neg_mul`: the building block `t ↦ e^{-x t}` for `x ≥ 0`.

/-- Roadmap-level complete monotonicity on the closed half-line.

This is the classical finite-measure hypothesis: the function is continuous on `[0, ∞)` and
completely monotone on the open half-line `(0, ∞)`. It is weaker at the endpoint than the existing
`IsCompletelyMonotone`, which requires all derivatives within `[0, ∞)` to exist at `0`. -/
