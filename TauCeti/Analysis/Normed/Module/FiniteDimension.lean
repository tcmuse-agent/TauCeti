# Finite-dimensional normed spaces

Over a complete nontrivially normed field every linear functional on a finite-dimensional normed
space is continuous, so the continuous dual `E →L[𝕜] 𝕜` coincides with the algebraic dual
`Module.Dual 𝕜 E`. Mathlib records that coincidence as the linear equivalence
`LinearMap.toContinuousLinearMap`; this file reads off the one consequence of it that dimension
counts need, namely that the continuous dual has the same dimension as the space.

Two complements of the same space in a finite-dimensional space are continuously linearly
isomorphic. This allows pointwise choices of complements to be identified with a single model.

## Main results

* `ContinuousLinearMap.dual_finrank_eq`: in finite dimensions the continuous dual has the same
  dimension as the space.
* `TauCeti.nonempty_continuousLinearEquiv_of_prod_continuousLinearEquiv`: complements of
  the same space in a finite-dimensional space are isomorphic.
