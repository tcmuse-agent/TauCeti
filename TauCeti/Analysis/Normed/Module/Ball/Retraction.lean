# The radial retraction onto a closed ball

In a real normed space, `TauCeti.radialRetraction r` scales a vector `x` by
`min 1 (r / ‖x‖)`. When `0 ≤ r`, it fixes the closed ball of radius `r` and pushes everything
outside it to the sphere of radius `r` along the ray through the origin. It is the standard device
for turning a map that is only Lipschitz near the origin into a globally Lipschitz map agreeing with
it near the origin, and it is used that way to cut off the nonlinearity of a differential equation
outside a small ball around an equilibrium.

For `0 ≤ r`, the retraction is `2`-Lipschitz in any normed space, and `2` is the constant carried
by `TauCeti.lipschitzWith_radialRetraction`; it is not optimal in every space (in a Hilbert space
the retraction is the metric projection onto a convex set, hence `1`-Lipschitz) but the exact
constant never matters for cutting off, where one is free to shrink the radius instead.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.radialRetraction`: scaling by `min 1 (r / ‖x‖)`; when `0 ≤ r`, this is the retraction
  onto the closed ball of radius `r` centred at the origin.
* `TauCeti.norm_radialRetraction`: for `0 ≤ r`, its norm is `min ‖x‖ r`.
* `TauCeti.radialRetraction_eventuallyEq_id`: inside the open ball, it agrees locally with the
  identity.
* `TauCeti.lipschitzWith_radialRetraction`: for `0 ≤ r`, it is `2`-Lipschitz.
* `LipschitzOnWith.comp_radialRetraction`: precomposing with it makes a map that is Lipschitz on
  the closed ball of radius `r` globally Lipschitz, with twice the constant.
