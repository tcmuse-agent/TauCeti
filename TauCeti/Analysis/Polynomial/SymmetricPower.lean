# The elementary symmetric chart is a homeomorphism

`TauCeti.Sym.coeffEquiv` presents the `n`-th symmetric power of an algebraically closed field `K`
as the affine space `Fin n → K`, by sending an unordered `n`-tuple to the lower coefficients of the
monic polynomial having it as its root multiset. That equivalence is pure algebra. This file proves
that, when `K` is a proper normed field — `ℂ` being the case of interest — it is a
**homeomorphism** for the quotient topology of `TauCeti.Sym.instTopologicalSpace`.

Both halves are elementary, but neither is formal:

* the coefficients are polynomial in the roots, so the chart is continuous;
* the roots are *not* a polynomial function of the coefficients, and continuity of the inverse is
  the classical statement that the roots of a monic polynomial depend continuously on its
  coefficients. It is obtained here from **Cauchy's bound** `Polynomial.cauchyBound`: a root of a
  monic polynomial is bounded by its coefficients, so the coefficient map is proper, hence closed,
  and a closed continuous bijection is a homeomorphism.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Sym.continuous_coeffEquiv_comp_ofFn`: the coefficients depend continuously on an
  ordered tuple of roots.
* `TauCeti.Polynomial.analyticAt_coeff_prod_X_sub_C` and
  `TauCeti.Sym.analyticAt_coeffEquiv_ofFn`: the same forward coefficient map is analytic over any
  nontrivially normed field.
* `TauCeti.Sym.norm_le_norm_coeffEquiv_ofFn_add_one`: Cauchy's bound on the symmetric power, that
  an ordered tuple is bounded by one more than the norm of its coefficient tuple.
* `TauCeti.Sym.isProperMap_coeffEquiv_comp_ofFn`: consequently the coefficient map
  `(Fin n → K) → (Fin n → K)` is proper.
* `TauCeti.Sym.coeffHomeomorph`: the **elementary symmetric chart** `Sym K n ≃ₜ (Fin n → K)`.
* `TauCeti.Sym.isOpenEmbedding_coeffEquiv_comp_map`: the chart induced by an open coordinate
  embedding, whose symmetric power is an open subspace of affine space.
* `TauCeti.Sym.isOpenEmbedding_coeffEquiv_comp_ofFn_map`: the chart on a product mapped into
  pairwise disjoint open coordinate ranges, one point in each.
* `TauCeti.Sym.analyticOnNhd_coeffEquiv_map_eval_coeffEquiv_symm`: applying a univariate
  polynomial to every point induces an analytic map in coefficient coordinates, including at
  tuples where points collide.

Lane F4.1 of the analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap opens with "`Sym^g(Σ)` geometry: smooth complex
structure (elementary symmetric functions)", after Ozsváth--Szabó
([arXiv:math/0101206](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0101206), §2.1): a holomorphic coordinate on the
surface identifies a neighbourhood in `Sym^g(Σ)` with an open subset of `Sym^g(ℂ)`, and the chart
below is what makes that a chart on a topological manifold; the charted structure is assembled
from it in `TauCeti/Geometry/Manifold/SymmetricPower.lean`. Away from the diagonal the continuity
proved here is upgraded to analyticity in
`TauCeti/Analysis/Polynomial/SimpleRoots/Basic.lean`, and its assembly across the blocks of an
elementary-symmetric chart, including colliding points over `ℂ`, is in
`TauCeti/Analysis/Polynomial/RootSum/Family.lean`. The complex atlas is
`TauCeti.isManifold_symChartedSpace`; the tangent-space criterion for products of locally
parametrized immersed curves is `TauCeti.isMaximalTotallyReal_range_fderiv_symChartAt_ofFn`.
For transition maps at colliding
tuples, this file also handles the case induced by a univariate polynomial; the general
holomorphic case over `ℂ` is
`TauCeti.Sym.analyticAt_coeffEquiv_map_coeffEquiv_symm_of_analyticAt` in
`TauCeti/Analysis/Polynomial/RootSum.lean`.
