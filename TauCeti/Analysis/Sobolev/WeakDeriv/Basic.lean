# Weak derivatives on an open set

Lane A of the PDE roadmap builds the Sobolev spaces `W^{k,p}(Ω)` of a domain out of *weak*
derivatives, rather than out of Mathlib's whole-space Bessel-potential scale. This file supplies
the underlying differentiation notion: for an open set `Ω` in a real normed space `E`, a measure
`μ` on `E`, functions `u, u' : E → F` and a direction `v : E`,

`TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn μ Ω u u' v`

says that the codomain `F` is complete, that `u` and `u'` are locally integrable on `Ω`, and that

`∫ (∂_v φ) • u ∂μ = - ∫ φ • u' ∂μ`

for every test function `φ ∈ 𝓓(Ω, ℝ)`; for the intended `μ`, an additive Haar measure, this says
that `u'` represents the distributional derivative `∂_v u` on `Ω` (see *The measure* below). The
bundled test-function type `TestFunction` of `Mathlib/Analysis/Distribution/TestFunction.lean` is
the class of admissible `φ`, so the test objects are exactly the distributional ones;
`TauCeti.hasWeakLineDerivOn_iff` restates the identity in terms of unbundled smooth compactly
supported functions when that is more convenient.

Assembling the directions gives `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn μ Ω u U` for a candidate weak derivative
`U : E → E →L[ℝ] F`, the object whose `Lᵖ` integrability cuts out `W^{1,p}(Ω)`.

Two facts make the notion usable, and both are proved here.

* **Uniqueness.** Two weak derivatives of the same function in the same direction agree almost
  everywhere on `Ω` (`TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.ae_eq` and `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn.ae_eq`). This
  is the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations, consumed from Mathlib in the form
  `IsOpen.ae_eq_zero_of_integral_contDiff_smul_eq_zero`.
* **Consistency.** For a Haar measure `μ`, a classical derivative that is locally integrable on
  `Ω` is a weak derivative (`TauCeti.hasWeakLineDerivOn_of_hasLineDerivAt`,
  `TauCeti.hasWeakFDerivOn_of_differentiableOn`), by integration by parts. Differentiability alone
  is not enough: local integrability of `u` and of its derivative is part of what it means to have
  a weak derivative, so both are hypotheses of these theorems and of the comparison theorems
  `TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.ae_eq_lineDeriv` and `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn.ae_eq_fderiv`.
  Together with uniqueness this pins the notion down: on a `C¹` function whose derivative is
  locally integrable on `Ω`, the weak derivative is the classical one almost everywhere.

Nothing here assumes that `Ω` is bounded or that its boundary is regular: the weak derivative is a
purely interior notion, and boundary hypotheses enter only with traces and extensions.

## Local integrability

`LocallyIntegrableOn u Ω μ` and `LocallyIntegrableOn u' Ω μ` are part of the definition rather
than side hypotheses on the theorems. That is the textbook statement — a weak derivative is a
relation between two members of `L¹_loc(Ω)` — and in Lean it is also what makes the predicate say
what it claims: `MeasureTheory.integral` is `0` on a function that is not integrable, so the bare
integration-by-parts identity is satisfied spuriously by junk-valued pairs, for instance by any
`u` with a non-integrable singularity inside `Ω` together with `u' = 0`. Mathlib guards the same
corner in `TestFunction.integralAgainstBilinCLM`, which pairs against a function only when it is
locally integrable on `Ω` and is the zero map otherwise.

The components are projected out by `TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.completeSpace`,
`TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.locallyIntegrableOn`,
`TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.locallyIntegrableOn_deriv` and
`TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.integral_lineDeriv_smul_eq_neg_integral_smul`, so a proof never has to
unfold the definition.

## The codomain

`CompleteSpace F` is a component of the definition, for the same reason local integrability is.
`MeasureTheory.integral` is *defined* to be `0` on an incomplete codomain, so for an incomplete
`F` the identity above would read `0 = -0` and the predicate would degenerate into local
integrability of `u` and `u'`, making every locally integrable function a weak derivative of every
other. Carrying completeness makes the predicate say what its name claims for every `F`, and
`TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.completeSpace` recovers the instance — usually as
`have := h.completeSpace` — so the results that consume it, such as the fundamental lemma of the
calculus of variations behind `TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.ae_eq`, get it from the hypothesis.

## The measure

The defining identity is *not* the distributional derivative for an arbitrary `μ`, and is not
advertised as one. Integrating against `μ` produces the adjoint of `∂_v` relative to `μ`: for a
weighted `μ = volume.withDensity w`, the identity reads `∂_v (w • u) = w • u'` in the sense of
distributions, a condition on `u` and `u'` in which the weight cannot be cancelled: it constrains
`w • u'`, not `u'`, so a constant `u` need not have weak derivative `0`. Exactly when `μ` is
translation invariant — an additive Haar measure, hence a positive multiple of Lebesgue measure
on a finite-dimensional `E` — does the identity say that `u'` represents `∂_v u` as a
distribution on `Ω`, and that is the `μ` out of which `W^{k,p}(Ω)` will be built.

Accordingly `[μ.IsAddHaarMeasure]` is a hypothesis of every result below that ties the notion to
the classical derivative: `TauCeti.hasWeakLineDerivOn_of_hasLineDerivAt`,
`TauCeti.hasWeakLineDerivOn_const`, `TauCeti.hasWeakFDerivOn_of_differentiableOn`,
`TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.ae_eq_lineDeriv` and `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn.ae_eq_fderiv`. It is
carried by those results rather than built into the definition, following Mathlib's own treatment
of `MeasureTheory.convolution`, whose definition takes a bare `μ` and whose group-invariance
hypotheses sit on the lemmas that need them: locality, linearity and almost-everywhere uniqueness
are true of the adjoint relation for every `μ`, and stating them for a Haar measure only would
weaken them for no gain.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn`: `u'` is a weak derivative of `u` in the direction `v` on `Ω`,
  relative to `μ`.
* `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn`: `U` is a weak (Fréchet) derivative of `u` on `Ω`.
* `TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.completeSpace`, `TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.locallyIntegrableOn`,
  `TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.locallyIntegrableOn_deriv` and
  `TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.integral_lineDeriv_smul_eq_neg_integral_smul`: the components of the
  definition.
* `TauCeti.hasWeakLineDerivOn_iff`: the unbundled restatement of the defining identity.
* `TauCeti.integrable_smul_of_locallyIntegrableOn` and
  `TauCeti.integrable_lineDeriv_smul_of_locallyIntegrableOn`: the two integrability facts that
  make the defining integrals honest.
* `TauCeti.setIntegral_smul_eq_integral_smul` and
  `TauCeti.setIntegral_lineDeriv_smul_eq_integral_lineDeriv_smul`: a test function on `Ω` and its
  directional derivative vanish off `Ω`, so the defining integrals may equivalently be taken over
  `Ω`.
* `TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.mono` and `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn.mono`: a weak derivative on `Ω`
  is one on every smaller open set.
* `TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.congr_ae` and `.congr_ae_deriv`, together with their
  `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn` counterparts: the notion only sees the function and its weak
  derivative up to almost-everywhere equality on `Ω`.
* `TauCeti.hasWeakLineDerivOn_zero` and `TauCeti.hasWeakFDerivOn_zero`: the zero function has
  weak derivative `0`.
* `TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.add`, `.neg`, `.sub`, `.const_smul`, `.sum` and their
  `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn` counterparts: linearity in the function.
* `TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.clm_comp`: a continuous linear map on the codomain passes through
  the weak derivative, which is how a vector-valued weak derivative is read off its scalar
  components.
* `TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.add_direction`, `.smul_direction`, `.sum_direction` and
  `TauCeti.hasWeakLineDerivOn_zero_direction`: linearity in the direction, which is what makes
  the `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn` packaging the right one.
* `Module.Basis.hasWeakFDerivOn_of_forall`: a candidate weak derivative need only be checked in
  the directions of a basis.
* `TauCeti.hasWeakLineDerivOn_of_hasLineDerivAt` and
  `TauCeti.hasWeakFDerivOn_of_differentiableOn`: classical derivatives that are locally integrable
  on `Ω` are weak derivatives.
* `TauCeti.hasWeakLineDerivOn_const`: against a Haar measure, a constant has weak derivative `0`.
* `TauCeti.hasWeakFDerivOn_testFunction`: a test function has weak derivative the linear
  functional represented by its gradient.
* `TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.ae_eq` and `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn.ae_eq`: uniqueness almost
  everywhere on `Ω`.
* `TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.ae_eq_lineDeriv` and `TauCeti.HasWeakFDerivOn.ae_eq_fderiv`: where
  the classical derivative exists and is locally integrable on `Ω`, the weak one agrees with it
  almost everywhere.

variable [MeasurableSpace E] {μ : Measure E} {u u' : E → F}

/-- `HasWeakLineDerivOn μ Ω u u' v` says that `u'` is a **weak derivative** of `u` in the
direction `v` on the open set `Ω`, relative to the measure `μ`: the codomain `F` is complete, both
functions are locally integrable on `Ω`, and the integration-by-parts identity

`∫ (∂_v φ) • u ∂μ = - ∫ φ • u' ∂μ`

holds for every test function `φ : 𝓓(Ω, ℝ)`, that is, for every smooth `φ : E → ℝ` whose support
is compact and contained in `Ω`.

Local integrability and completeness of `F` are part of the definition because without them the
identity is a statement about junk-valued integrals — `MeasureTheory.integral` is `0` on a
non-integrable function, and `0` outright on an incomplete codomain — and would be satisfied by
pairs that are not weakly differentiable at all; see the module docstring. They are recovered by
`TauCeti.HasWeakLineDerivOn.locallyIntegrableOn`, `.locallyIntegrableOn_deriv` and
`.completeSpace`, the last of which is how a proof gets the `CompleteSpace F` instance.

For the intended `μ`, an additive Haar measure, this says exactly that `u'` represents the
distributional derivative `∂_v u` on `Ω`, and `[μ.IsAddHaarMeasure]` is the hypothesis of every
result identifying the two (`TauCeti.hasWeakLineDerivOn_of_hasLineDerivAt` and
`TauCeti.hasWeakLineDerivOn_const` among them). For a `μ` that is not translation invariant the
identity is instead the adjoint of `∂_v` relative to `μ` — with a weight `w` it describes
`∂_v (w • u)`, so a constant need not have weak derivative `0`; see the module docstring. -/

`u` in the direction `v`. In particular `F` is complete and `u` and each `x ↦ U x v` are locally
integrable on `Ω`.
