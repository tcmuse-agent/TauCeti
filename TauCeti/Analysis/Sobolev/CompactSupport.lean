# Extending a compactly supported weak derivative across the boundary

Extending a weakly differentiable function by zero across `∂Ω` destroys weak differentiability in
general: the jump along the boundary contributes a singular term that no locally integrable
function represents.  This file proves that the obstruction is entirely a boundary phenomenon.
If `u` and its weak derivative vanish almost everywhere outside a **compact** `K ⊆ Ω`, then the
extension of `u` by zero is weakly differentiable on the whole space, with the zero-extension of
the weak derivative as its derivative.

## The argument

Test the extension against a test function `φ` on the whole space.  A smooth cutoff `χ` equal to
`1` on a neighbourhood of `K` and compactly supported inside `Ω`
(`IsCompact.exists_contDiff_cutoff`) turns `χ φ` into a test function *on `Ω`*, to which the
hypothesis applies.  The product rule replaces `∂_v (χ φ)` by `χ ∂_v φ + (∂_v χ) φ`, and both
correction terms vanish where they are paired with `u`: off `K` because `u` does, and on `K`
because `χ` is constant there.  What is left is the defining identity for the extension.

Nothing is assumed about `∂Ω`; the compact support is what replaces boundary regularity.  The
same statement for a general `u ∈ W^{1,p}(Ω)` is false, and the extension theorem that repairs it
needs a Lipschitz boundary.

/-- **Extension by zero of a compactly supported weak directional derivative.**  If `u'` is a
weak derivative of `u` in the direction `v` on `Ω`, and both vanish almost everywhere on `Ω`
outside a compact `K ⊆ Ω`, then the zero-extension of `u'` is a weak derivative of the
zero-extension of `u` on the whole space.

No regularity of `∂Ω` is used: the cutoff isolating `K` from `∂Ω` is what makes the extension
weakly differentiable, and it exists for every open `Ω`. -/
