# Linear asymptotics as limits of ratios

A function `f` satisfies `f = a g + o(g)` exactly when `f / g` tends to `a`, provided `g` is
eventually nonzero. This is Mathlib's `Asymptotics.isLittleO_iff_tendsto'` applied to `f - a g`,
with the constant moved out of the ratio. Prime-number-theorem statements are proved in the first
form, since that is the form which adds and subtracts, and squeezed in the second, since that is
the form order arguments apply to.

## Main results

* `Asymptotics.isLittleO_sub_mul_iff_tendsto_div`: `f - a g = o(g)` if and only if
  `f / g → a`, for an eventually nonzero `g`.
