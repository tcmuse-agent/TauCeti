# Images of measure atoms

A positive finite-mass measurable atom is a measurable set whose measurable subsets have either
zero or full mass. Every almost-everywhere measurable map sends such an atom to one point of a
standard Borel target: the image of the measure restricted to the atom is a scalar multiple of a
Dirac measure.

The finite-mass hypothesis is essential: a zero-infinity measure may make its whole carrier an
atom while vanishing on every singleton.

## Main definitions

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.IsAtom` — a measurable positive-mass set whose measurable subsets
  have either zero measure or the full measure of the set.

## Main results

* `AEMeasurable.exists_ae_eq_const_restrict_of_atom` — an a.e.-measurable map into a standard
  Borel space is a.e. constant on every positive finite-mass measurable atom;
* `AEMeasurable.exists_map_restrict_eq_smul_dirac_of_atom` — an a.e.-measurable map from a
  positive finite-mass measurable atom into a standard Borel space has the corresponding point
  mass as its restricted pushforward;
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.nullSingletonClass_map_of_injective` — an injective measurable map
  into a space whose singletons are measurable preserves the property that singletons have
  measure zero.
