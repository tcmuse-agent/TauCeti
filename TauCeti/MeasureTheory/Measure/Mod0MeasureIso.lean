# Measure-preserving isomorphisms modulo null sets

`Mod0MeasureIso` bundles two measurable maps between measured spaces which push the two measures
forward onto one another and which are mutually inverse outside a null set. It is the
modulo-null-set counterpart of `MeasurePreserving`, for the situation in which two spaces carry
the same law only up to null sets, as happens when standard transport constructions are composed.

The packaging is adapted from Cameron Freer's independent implementation in
`Graphon/MeasureIso.lean` at commit `9f7be59fa754d260a544b4cfd83d6a5b94f7552e`:

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Mod0MeasureIso` is the structure; `TauCeti.Mod0MeasureIso.measurePreserving` and
  `TauCeti.Mod0MeasureIso.measurePreserving_invFun` read off the two measure-preserving maps,
  `TauCeti.Mod0MeasureIso.symm` inverts an isomorphism, and `TauCeti.Mod0MeasureIso.trans`
  composes two of them;
* `TauCeti.embeddingRealMod0MeasureIso` transports a standard-Borel space into `ℝ` by
  `embeddingReal`;
* `TauCeti.mod0MeasureIso_to_unitInterval` turns a mod-zero isomorphism into `ℝ` carrying the
  unit interval measure into measure-preserving maps in both directions between that space and
  the unit interval.

The instance built from the cumulative distribution function and the quantile of an atomless
real law is `MeasureTheory.Measure.realMod0MeasureIso`, in `TauCeti.Probability.Quantile`.
