# Atomless standard-Borel transport to the unit interval

This file proves that an atomless standard-Borel probability space is measure-preservingly
isomorphic modulo null sets to the unit interval with Lebesgue measure. The real-line
construction uses the cumulative distribution function and the generalized inverse already
provided by `MeasureTheory.Measure.quantile`, then transports a standard-Borel space to `ℝ`
by `embeddingReal`.

The CDF/quantile route is adapted from Cameron Freer's independent implementation in
`Graphon/MeasureIso.lean` at commit `9f7be59fa754d260a544b4cfd83d6a5b94f7552e`:
<https://github.com/cameronfreer/graphon/commit/9f7be59fa754d260a544b4cfd83d6a5b94f7552e>.
The graphon-specific packaging was removed. The original work is copyright Cameron Freer
and licensed under Apache 2.0. The underlying measure-preserving equivalence is also the
standard-Borel transport theorem in S. Janson, *Graphons, cut norm and distance, couplings
and rearrangements*, Theorem A.7.

Here `NullSingletonClass μ` is the formal hypothesis. On a standard-Borel space it gives the
atomlessness used by the CDF argument; the class itself only asserts that every singleton is
null. The mod-zero isomorphism machinery it composes is
`TauCeti.Mod0MeasureIso`; this module composes the two transports and
exports the resulting theorem `exists_mpModNull_equiv_unitInterval`.

/-! ### The atomless real-line isomorphism

The mod-zero isomorphism between an atomless standard-Borel probability space and Lebesgue
measure on the unit interval is the composite of the standard-Borel transport into `ℝ` with the
CDF/quantile transport along `ℝ`. -/
