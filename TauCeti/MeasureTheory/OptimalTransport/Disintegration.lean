# Disintegrating transport plans

A coupling can be read in two equivalent ways: as a measure on a product with prescribed
marginals, or as a source measure followed by a probability kernel whose averaged law is the
target. This file connects the coupling API to Mathlib's composition-product and regular
conditional-kernel APIs.

For a Markov kernel `κ : Kernel X Y`, the composition-product `μ ⊗ₘ κ` couples `μ` to the
averaged law `κ ∘ₘ μ`. Conversely, when the target space is standard Borel, a finite coupling
`π` reconstructs as `μ ⊗ₘ π.condKernel`, and its conditional kernel averages to the prescribed
target. Any other finite kernel reconstructing the same plan agrees with `π.condKernel`
`μ`-almost everywhere.

When the plan is concentrated on a set that meets almost every vertical line in at most one
point, the conditional kernel is almost everywhere a Dirac mass, so the plan is determined by its
source marginal and that set; this is the form in which uniqueness of contact partners becomes
uniqueness of optimal plans.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.isCoupling_compProd` constructs a coupling from a source measure and a Markov kernel;
* `TauCeti.isCoupling_compProd_iff` characterizes when that coupling has a specified target;
* `TauCeti.IsCoupling.compProd_condKernel` reconstructs a finite coupling from its source
  marginal and Mathlib's conditional kernel;
* `TauCeti.IsCoupling.condKernel_comp` identifies the averaged conditional law with the target
  marginal;
* `TauCeti.IsCoupling.ae_eq_condKernel_iff_compProd_eq` gives the coupling-facing uniqueness
  criterion for conditional kernels;
* `TauCeti.IsCoupling.compProd_condDistrib` and
  `TauCeti.IsCoupling.condDistrib_ae_eq_condKernel` give the same reconstruction through the
  conditional distribution of the two coordinate maps and identify the two Mathlib interfaces;
* `TauCeti.IsCoupling.ae_exists_condKernel_eq_dirac` and
  `TauCeti.IsCoupling.eq_of_ae_mem_of_subsingleton` — a coupling concentrated on a set with
  almost all sections subsingletons has Dirac conditional laws, and is determined by its source
  marginal and that set;
* the corresponding declarations in `TauCeti.Coupling` specialize these results to the bundled
  probability-coupling type.

This is Layer 0, item 3 of the optimal-transport roadmap. The construction and uniqueness theorem
consume Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.Measure.disintegrate` and
`ProbabilityTheory.eq_condKernel_of_measure_eq_compProd`; no disintegration is rebuilt here.
