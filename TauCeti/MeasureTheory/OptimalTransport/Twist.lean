# The twist condition and uniqueness of contact partners

Let `φ`, `ψ` be a dual feasible pair for a real cost `c` on `E × Y`, where `E` is a real normed
space, so that `φ x' + ψ y ≤ c (x', y)` everywhere, and let `(x, y)` lie in their contact set,
where this is an equality. Then `x' ↦ c (x', y) - φ x'` attains its minimum at `x`. If both `φ`
and the section `c (·, y)` are differentiable at `x`, the first-order condition for that
minimum says that the derivative of the potential at `x` is the `x`-derivative of the cost at
`(x, y)`:

`D φ (x) = Dₓ c (x, y)`.

The right-hand side depends on `y` and the left-hand side does not. So if the cost satisfies the
*twist condition* — for each `x`, the map `y ↦ Dₓ c (x, y)` is injective — then at every point
where `φ` is differentiable there is at most one contact partner `y`. When `φ` is differentiable
`μ`-almost everywhere, almost every contact fibre is therefore a subsingleton.

A plan concentrated on the contact set then has deterministic conditional laws: together with
`TauCeti.IsCoupling.ae_exists_condKernel_eq_dirac`, the conditional kernel of such a coupling is,
for `μ`-almost every `x`, the Dirac mass at the unique contact partner of `x`. Once a dual
optimizer exists, every optimal plan is concentrated on its contact set
(`TauCeti.IsDualCertificate.of_isOptimalCoupling`), so this gives uniqueness of the optimal plan,
`TauCeti.IsDualCertificate.eq_of_isOptimalCoupling`. This gives deterministic conditional laws
and uniqueness of optimal plans for twisted costs under the stated nonnegativity and
almost-everywhere differentiability hypotheses. The Euclidean quadratic cost satisfies the
twist condition since `Dₓ c (x, y) = x - y` up to the Riesz identification. Differentiable,
strictly convex displacement costs `c (x, y) = h (x - y)` also fit when `h` is nonnegative,
its sections are differentiable at contact partners, and the potential is differentiable
`μ`-almost everywhere; then `Dₓ c (x, y) = D h (x - y)`.

The potential `φ` is extended-real valued, as the `c`-concave potentials of
`TauCeti.cTransformSymm` are. It is differentiated through `EReal.toReal`, and the statements
ask that `φ` not take the value `⊥` near the point, since the dual constraint carries no
information where `φ = ⊥`. The value `⊤` is excluded automatically wherever the constraint holds
against a contact partner.

The pointwise statements, `TauCeti.hasFDerivAt_eq_of_mem_contactSet` and
`TauCeti.subsingleton_setOf_mem_contactSet`, use only local feasibility and differentiability of
the cost sections at the contact partners, with twist asked for on the set where the
`x`-derivative of the cost exists. The measure-level statements require these hypotheses only
`μ`-almost everywhere. Nothing about semiconcavity of the cost is assumed; the differentiability
of `φ` is a hypothesis, to be supplied by a Rademacher-type theorem for the potentials at hand.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.hasFDerivAt_eq_of_mem_contactSet` — the first-order condition `D φ (x) = Dₓ c (x, y)`
  at a contact point, and `TauCeti.fderiv_eq_of_mem_contactSet` its `fderiv` form;
* `TauCeti.subsingleton_setOf_mem_contactSet` — under the twist condition, a point where the
  potential is differentiable has at most one contact partner;
* `TauCeti.fderiv_norm_sub_sq_div_two_injective` — the quadratic cost `‖x - y‖ ^ 2 / 2` on a
  real inner product space is twisted;
* `TauCeti.ae_subsingleton_setOf_mem_contactSet` — the contact fibres are almost all
  subsingletons when the potential is differentiable almost everywhere;
* `TauCeti.IsDualCertificate.ae_exists_condKernel_eq_dirac` — optimal couplings have almost
  everywhere Dirac conditional laws at contact partners;
* `TauCeti.IsDualCertificate.eq_of_isOptimalCoupling` — under the same hypotheses, a coupling
  certified by a dual pair is the only optimal coupling.
