# The monotone quantile coupling of two real laws

Two probability laws on `ℝ` are simultaneously represented by their quantile functions: each is
the law of its own quantile function under the uniform law on the open unit interval. Reading the
two quantile functions off the *same* uniform variable produces the **monotone coupling**

`μ.quantileCoupling ν = (volume.restrict (Ioo 0 1)).map fun t ↦ (μ.quantile t, ν.quantile t)`,

the classical monotone rearrangement of the two laws: both coordinates are nondecreasing
functions of one and the same variable, by `MeasureTheory.Measure.monotoneOn_quantile`. It is a
genuine transport plan of `μ` and `ν`, and its transport objective for the ground distance of `ℝ`
is the `L^p (0,1)` distance of the two quantile functions. Every `p`-Wasserstein distance of two
real laws is therefore at most that explicit one-dimensional integral.

The reverse inequality — that the monotone coupling is optimal, so that the bound below is an
identity for every exponent `1 ≤ p ≤ ∞` — is a rearrangement inequality for the costs
`|x - y| ^ p`, proved in `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.OptimalTransport.Wasserstein.Rearrangement` as
`TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_eq_eLpNorm_quantile_sub`.

## Main definitions

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.quantileCoupling` — the monotone coupling of two real laws.

## Main statements

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.isCoupling_quantileCoupling` — the monotone coupling is a transport plan;
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.quantileCoupling_Iic_prod_Ioi` — its mass on a quadrant
  `Iic a ×ˢ Ioi b` is the positive part of `cdf μ a - cdf ν b`;
* `TauCeti.eLpNorm_edist_quantileCoupling` — its transport objective is the `L^p (0,1)` distance
  of the two quantile functions;
* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_le_eLpNorm_quantile_sub` — the resulting upper bound on the
  Wasserstein distance of two real laws.
