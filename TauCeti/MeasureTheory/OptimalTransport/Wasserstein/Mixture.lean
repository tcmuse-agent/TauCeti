# The Wasserstein distance of mixtures

For a finite nonzero exponent `p`, the `p`-th power of the `p`-Wasserstein distance is jointly
convex in the two laws: for weights `a i`,

`W_p (∑ i, a i • μ i, ∑ i, a i • ν i) ^ p ≤ ∑ i, a i * W_p (μ i, ν i) ^ p`.

For a probability vector `a` this is the mixture bound for `W_p`. It is the transport-cost
convexity of `TauCeti.transportCost_smul` and `TauCeti.transportCost_sum_le` read through the
bridge `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_rpow_eq_transportCost` for the cost `edist ^ p`.

The weights are only required to be finite and need not sum to `1`, and the laws are arbitrary
measures. The ground distance must be jointly measurable, since the transport cost is computed
through it, but `1 ≤ p` is not used. The exponent is
finite: at `p = ∞` the power `p.toReal` is `0`, and the corresponding estimate instead bounds
the distance of the mixtures by the largest distance of a pair with positive weight, which is a
different statement not proved here.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_finset_sum_smul_rpow_le` — the mixture bound for finitely many laws;
* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_sum_smul_rpow_le` — the mixture bound for countably many laws, written
  with `MeasureTheory.Measure.sum`;
* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_add_rpow_le` — subadditivity of `W_p ^ p` for two pairs of measures.

  convexity of the optimal transport cost, applied here to the cost `edist ^ p`.
