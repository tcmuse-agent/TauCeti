# Lower semicontinuity of the Wasserstein distance under weak convergence

On a Polish ground space the `p`-Wasserstein distance is a lower semicontinuous function of the
pair of laws for the weak topology on `ProbabilityMeasure X × ProbabilityMeasure X`: if
`μₙ ⇀ μ` and `νₙ ⇀ ν`, then

`W_p (μ, ν) ≤ liminf W_p (μₙ, νₙ)`.

The inequality can be strict — for `μₙ = (1 - 1 / n) δ₀ + (1 / n) δₙ` on `ℝ` one has `μₙ ⇀ δ₀`
while `W₁ (μₙ, δ₀) = 1` — so weak convergence does not make `W_p` continuous; that needs the
convergence of `p`-moments as well. Lower semicontinuity is what the direct method consumes
whenever a Wasserstein distance appears in a functional to be minimised over weakly compact sets
of laws.

For a positive finite exponent the distance is a continuous increasing function of the optimal
transport cost of `edist ^ p` (`TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_rpow_eq_transportCost`), and that cost is
weakly lower semicontinuous in the marginals by `TauCeti.lowerSemicontinuous_transportCost`; at
exponent zero the distance between probability measures vanishes. These arguments need only an
extended pseudometric whose topology is Polish. The endpoint `p = ∞` follows on a Polish metric
space from `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_top_eq_iSup`, since a supremum of lower semicontinuous
functions is lower semicontinuous.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.lowerSemicontinuous_wassersteinEDist_of_ne_top` — lower semicontinuity for every finite
  exponent, on an extended pseudometric space with Polish topology;
* `TauCeti.lowerSemicontinuous_wassersteinEDist` — lower semicontinuity for every exponent,
  including `p = ∞`, on a Polish metric space;
* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_le_liminf` — its form along weakly convergent families of laws.
