# The Wasserstein distance of two measures

For an exponent `p : ℝ≥0∞` the *`p`-Wasserstein distance* of two measures `μ` and `ν` on a common
space carrying an extended distance is

`W_p (μ, ν) = ⨅ π, eLpNorm (fun z ↦ edist z.1 z.2) p π`,

the infimum taken over the couplings `π` of `μ` and `ν`. This file defines
`TauCeti.wassersteinEDist` and proves the identities that make it a distance: it vanishes on the
diagonal, it is symmetric, it is monotone in the exponent, it satisfies the triangle inequality,
and — on a genuine metric space with the hypotheses under which the infimum is attained — it
separates measures.

Writing the objective as an `eLpNorm` rather than as a root of an integral is what makes the
exponent `p = ∞` a case of the definition instead of a separate one: at that endpoint the value is
the infimum of the coupling-wise essential suprema of the ground distance. For `1 ≤ p < ∞` the two
readings agree, and `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_rpow_eq_transportCost` is the exact bridge to the
primal Kantorovich problem of `TauCeti.transportCost` for the cost `edist ^ p`.

The two-variable transport identities below assume joint measurability of the ground extended
distance, `Measurable fun z : X × X ↦ edist z.1 z.2`. This is not automatic for an abstract
`PseudoEMetricSpace` sitting on an unrelated measurable space, and it is exactly what is needed to
move the objective along a pushforward; on a second countable Borel space it is Mathlib's
`measurable_edist`. The same hypothesis is what makes the objective computable at all, since
`MeasureTheory.eLpNorm` is `∞` for a function that is not almost-everywhere strongly measurable:
that is why the two endpoint readings at `p = 0` and `p = ∞` and the transport-cost bridge ask for
it, even though no pushforward is involved. The pure finite-moment results use only
almost-everywhere strong measurability
of the relevant distance sections, the two-Dirac value needs no measurability at all, and the
vanishing on the diagonal needs only a measurable diagonal, `MeasurableEq`. Nothing else about the
topology is assumed until the triangle inequality asks for a standard Borel structure, which is
what the gluing lemma consumes.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist p μ ν` — the infimum of `eLpNorm (fun z ↦ edist z.1 z.2) p π` over the
  couplings `π` of `μ` and `ν`.
* `TauCeti.HasFiniteMoment p μ` — the `MemLp` finite-moment condition about some basepoint, with
  `TauCeti.hasFiniteMoment_of_ae_mem_finset` supplying finite moments for finite carriers.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_le` and `TauCeti.le_wassersteinEDist` — the two halves of the universal
  property of the infimum, with `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_map_le` providing the graph-plan
  pushforward bound, `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_lt_iff` its order-theoretic restatement, and
  `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_eq_top_iff` the characterization of an infinite value;
* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_add_smul_dirac_le` — the coupling estimate for moving part of a
  measure to a single point;
* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_top` — the `p = ∞` characterization by coupling-wise essential
  suprema;
* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_self`, `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_comm` and
  `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_triangle` — the three axioms of an extended pseudodistance;
* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_mono_exponent` — monotonicity in `p` when the first marginal is a
  probability measure;
* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_dirac_left`, `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_dirac_right` and
  `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_dirac_dirac` — the unique-coupling identity
  `W_p (δ_x, ν) = ‖edist x ·‖_{L^p (ν)}`, its mirror image, and the two-Dirac value `edist x y`;
* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_dirac_left_le_add` and `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_dirac_left_ne_top` —
  bounds for changing the basepoint, inside a fixed finite-distance component;
* `TauCeti.memLp_edist_iff_wassersteinEDist_dirac_ne_top` and
  `TauCeti.memLp_edist_iff_of_edist_ne_top` — the `MemLp` form of the Dirac identity and
  basepoint independence, with `TauCeti.hasFiniteMoment_iff_memLp_edist` and
  `TauCeti.hasFiniteMoment_iff_wassersteinEDist_dirac_ne_top` testing the finite-moment predicate
  itself at a prescribed basepoint of a pseudometric ground space;
* `TauCeti.hasFiniteMoment_iff_wassersteinEDist_ne_top_of_hasFiniteMoment` — the same test against
  a general finite-moment anchor, read off from
  `TauCeti.memLp_edist_iff_hasFiniteMoment_of_isCoupling`, which compares displacement and moment
  along a single coupling, and with
  `TauCeti.hasFiniteMoment_iff_forall_hasFiniteMoment_iff_wassersteinEDist_ne_top` recording that
  the finite-moment hypothesis on the anchor cannot be dropped;
* `TauCeti.HasFiniteMoment.integrable_of_lipschitzWith` — a Lipschitz real function is integrable
  against a finite measure of finite first moment;
* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_rpow_eq_transportCost` and
  `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_eq_transportCost_rpow` — for `0 < p < ∞`, the exact bridge to Layer 1's
  transport cost of `edist ^ p`, with `TauCeti.isOptimalCoupling_edist_rpow_iff` identifying the
  minimizers and `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_one_eq_transportCost` giving the case `p = 1`;
* `TauCeti.exists_isCoupling_eLpNorm_eq_wassersteinEDist` — on a Polish metric space and for a
  finite nonzero exponent, between finite measures that admit a coupling, the infimum is attained;
* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_eq_zero_iff` — on a Polish metric space and for a finite nonzero
  exponent, `W_p (μ, ν) = 0` exactly when `μ = ν` if the source measure is finite, with
  `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_top_eq_zero_iff` giving the endpoint `p = ∞` under the same
  finiteness hypothesis and `TauCeti.eq_of_wassersteinEDist_eq_zero` packaging the two into a
  single statement.

## Implementation notes

The infimum is an iterated `⨅` over plans and over proofs of `TauCeti.IsCoupling`, matching
`TauCeti.transportCost`: measures with no coupling at all — for instance two finite measures of
different total mass — get the value `∞` with no case split, and `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_le` is
`iInf₂_le`.

The exponent is unrestricted in the definition. Only `1 ≤ p` makes the triangle inequality true,
and `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_exponent_zero` records that the value collapses to `0` at `p = 0`
whenever the two measures are coupled at all. A theorem carries `p ≠ 0` exactly when it needs it:
the two-Dirac value, the transport-cost bridge, attainment and separation do, while the
order-theoretic API, the vanishing on the diagonal, symmetry, the one-sided Dirac identities and
`TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_mono_exponent` — monotonicity holds already from `p = 0` — do not.

The measures are raw `MeasureTheory.Measure`s, not bundled probability measures. Monotonicity in
the exponent and the Dirac identities take the `MeasureTheory.IsProbabilityMeasure` instances they
use. Attainment and separation apply to finite equal-mass measures by normalising and rescaling,
while the order-theoretic API, symmetry and the vanishing on the diagonal hold for arbitrary
measures.

This is Layer 3, item 1 of the optimal-transport roadmap. The basepoint-independence lemmas that
item 2 rests on are proved here, on the Dirac identity; the finite-moment spaces `P_p (X)`
themselves and the metric structure carried by an anchored finite-distance component are item 2
and are not built here.

/-- **The two-Dirac value.** The only coupling of `δ x` with `δ y` is `δ (x, y)`, so the
Wasserstein distance of two Dirac measures is the ground distance of their atoms, for every
nonzero exponent. This is the acceptance check `W_p (δ_x, δ_y) = d (x, y)`.

Uniqueness of the coupling pins the infimum down without any measurability of the ground
distance, which is also what makes this a usable `simp` lemma: the one-sided Dirac identities
that would otherwise normalise its left-hand side all ask for a jointly measurable ground
distance, so they do not fire here. -/
