# Approximation of a finite-moment law by a finitely supported one

On a separable ground space every probability measure with finite `p`-moment can be pushed within
any prescribed Wasserstein accuracy by a quantizer, for every finite exponent `1 ≤ p < ∞`. When
singletons are measurable, these pushforwards are measures carried by finite sets. This file also
records the two standard consequences: the finitely supported laws are dense in
`TauCeti.WassersteinSpace p X` under the compatible standard-Borel and second-countability
hypotheses, and the `N`-point quantization error of a fixed law tends to `0`.

The approximating measures are produced by a *quantizer*: a measurable map `T : X → X` with
finitely many values, approximating the identity. The displacement bound
`TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_map_le` — the graph plan of `T` is a coupling of `μ` with `μ.map T`, so
the Wasserstein distance between them is at most the `L^p (μ)` seminorm of `x ↦ edist x (T x)` —
turns an estimate on the displacement into an estimate on the distance. The map itself sends `x`
to `u i`, for the least index `i` of a dense sequence `u` with `dist x (u i) < δ` when that index
is smaller than a cutoff `n`, and to `u 0` otherwise. The displacement is then at most `δ` off the
tail set of points whose least index is at least `n`, and those tail sets decrease to the empty
set, so the finite `p`-moment about `u 0` makes their contribution vanish by dominated
convergence.

This file also provides the finite-support transport estimate and the approximation of a finitely
supported law by one whose weights have a common natural denominator, the rounding of the weights
themselves being `TauCeti.exists_nat_weights_of_sum_eq_one`, together with
the companion quantization onto the terms of a prescribed dense sequence, which sends a point to
the first term of the sequence within the prescribed accuracy of it.

The construction uses a finite exponent: at `p = ∞` a displacement that is small off a set of
small measure is not small in `L^∞`, and finitely supported laws need not be `W_∞`-dense on a
general separable metric space (for example, on a countably infinite discrete metric space).
The ground space is separable, which is where the dense sequence comes from.

## Support conventions

A quantizer statement — the map `T` takes finitely many values — is available on a pseudometric
ground space, whereas the assertion that a measure gives mass `0` to the complement of a finite
set is not: in a pseudometric space that complement need not be measurable. On an infinite type
with the zero pseudometric and its Borel structure, no probability measure vanishes on the
complement of a finite set. The measure-level statements therefore ask for measurable singletons,
which a metric ground space with its Borel structure supplies for free. For the same reason the
finite carrier is recorded as a `Finset X` whose complement is null, rather than through
`MeasureTheory.Measure.support`: on a pseudometric space the topological support of a Dirac law is
the whole ball of radius `0` around its atom, so it is not finite.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_map_le` — the displacement bound: `W_p (μ, T_* μ)` is at most the
  `L^p (μ)` seminorm of `x ↦ edist x (T x)`;
* `TauCeti.hasFiniteMoment_of_ae_mem_finset` — a law carried by a finite set has finite
  `p`-moment for every exponent;
* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_sum_smul_dirac_le` — a transport bound for perturbing the weights of a
  finitely supported law;
* `TauCeti.exists_nat_weights_wassersteinEDist_le` — approximation by weights with a common
  natural denominator;
* `TauCeti.exists_map_range_wassersteinEDist_le` — quantization onto a dense sequence: some
  measurable map with values among the terms of a dense sequence pushes `ν` to within `δ` of
  itself;
* `TauCeti.exists_map_wassersteinEDist_le` — the approximation theorem in quantizer form: some
  measurable map with finitely many values pushes `μ` to within `ε` of itself;
* `TauCeti.exists_ae_mem_finset_wassersteinEDist_le` — its measure form, with the approximating
  law carried by a finite set and again of finite `p`-moment, assuming measurable singletons;
* `TauCeti.WassersteinSpace.dense_setOfPred_ae_mem_finset` — the finitely supported laws are dense
  in `P_p (X)` on a pseudometric ground space with `[StandardBorelSpace X]`, `[BorelSpace X]`,
  and `[SecondCountableTopology X]`;
* `TauCeti.wassersteinQuantizationError` and `TauCeti.tendsto_wassersteinQuantizationError` — the
  `N`-point quantization error and its convergence to `0`.

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.wassersteinQuantizationError` is an infimum over competitors, so it is defined without
any hypothesis on the ground space and carries no attainment claim: a best `N`-point quantizer
need not exist at this generality, and the rate at which the error decays is a separate question
with its own hypotheses. Only `TauCeti.tendsto_wassersteinQuantizationError` uses the
approximation theorem.

`TauCeti.exists_map_range_wassersteinEDist_le` takes the measurability of the ground distance
explicitly, so that a caller with a Borel structure can supply it and one without can still use
the estimate.

The approximation theorem is stated with a target accuracy `ε : ℝ≥0∞` rather than as a limit
along a sequence of quantizers, because the sequence of cutoffs is chosen after the radius and
the two are not indexed by a single parameter.
