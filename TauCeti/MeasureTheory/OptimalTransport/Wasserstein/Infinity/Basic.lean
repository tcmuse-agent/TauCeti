# The Wasserstein distance at the infinite exponent

At `p = ∞` the Wasserstein distance `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist ∞ μ ν` is the infimum, over the
couplings `π` of `μ` and `ν`, of the `π`-essential supremum of the ground distance
(`TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_top`). This file proves, on a Polish metric space, the two facts that
tie this endpoint to the finite exponents and make it usable:

* the infimum is attained, between any two finite measures that admit a coupling;
* for probability measures, `W_∞ (μ, ν)` is the supremum of the finite-exponent distances
  `W_p (μ, ν)`, and it is their limit as `p → ∞`.

Both are identities in `[0, ∞]`: no bounded support or moment hypothesis is needed, since a
divergent supremum and an infinite `W_∞` are allowed on both sides. Monotonicity in the exponent,
`TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_mono_exponent`, makes the supremum over all finite exponents the same as
the supremum over `1 ≤ p < ∞`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_top_eq_iSup` — `W_∞ (μ, ν) = ⨆ p < ∞, W_p (μ, ν)` when `μ` is a
  probability measure;
* `TauCeti.tendsto_wassersteinEDist_atTop` — `W_p (μ, ν) → W_∞ (μ, ν)` as `p → ∞`;
* `TauCeti.exists_isCoupling_eLpNorm_top_eq_wassersteinEDist` — attainment of the infimum defining
  `W_∞`, between finite measures that admit a coupling.

## Implementation notes

Monotonicity gives `⨆ p < ∞, W_p ≤ W_∞`. For the other inequality, write `L` for the supremum.
The couplings `π` with `‖d‖_{Lⁿ(π)} ≤ L` form a decreasing sequence of nonempty weakly closed
subsets of the weakly compact set of couplings: nonempty by attainment at finite exponents, closed
because `π ↦ ∫⁻ dⁿ ∂π` is lower semicontinuous. A coupling in their intersection has all its `Lⁿ`
displacements at most `L`, hence its essential-supremum displacement is at most `L`, because the
`Lⁿ` seminorms of a function converge to its essential supremum
(`TauCeti.tendsto_eLpNorm_atTop`). That coupling attains `W_∞`, which is how attainment and the
supremum formula come out of the same argument.
