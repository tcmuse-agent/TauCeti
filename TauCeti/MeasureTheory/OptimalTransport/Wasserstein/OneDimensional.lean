# The Wasserstein distance of two real laws at exponent one

On the real line the transport problem for the ground distance is solved explicitly: for two
probability laws `μ` and `ν` on `ℝ`,

`W₁ (μ, ν) = ∫⁻ s, ‖cdf μ s - cdf ν s‖ₑ`,

the area between the two cumulative distribution functions. This is an identity in `[0, ∞]` and
needs no moment hypothesis: its two sides are infinite together, so laws with divergent first
moments are covered as they stand.

One measure-theoretic identity, proved in `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.Integral.LayerCake`, drives it,
`TauCeti.lintegral_enorm_sub_eq_lintegral_measure_symmDiff`: the `L¹` distance of two real
functions is the integral, over the levels `s`, of the measure of the set where exactly one of them
is at most `s`. On the two coordinates of a transport plan it rewrites the transport objective as
an integral of plan masses, each at least the gap between the two cumulative distribution functions
at that level, since a set on which exactly one coordinate is small carries at least the difference
of the two marginal masses. On the two quantile functions it rewrites the objective of the monotone
plan as the integral of exactly those gaps, by the Galois property of the quantile. Lower bound and
attained value therefore meet.

The quantile form of this identity, `W₁ (μ, ν) = ‖μ.quantile - ν.quantile‖_{L¹ (0, 1)}`, is the
exponent-one case of `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_eq_eLpNorm_quantile_sub`, which holds for every
exponent `1 ≤ p ≤ ∞`; the cumulative-distribution form is special to the exponent one.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.lintegral_enorm_quantile_sub_eq_lintegral_enorm_cdf_sub` — the `L¹ (0, 1)` distance of
  the two quantile functions is the area between the two cumulative distribution functions;
* `TauCeti.wassersteinEDist_one_eq_lintegral_enorm_cdf_sub` — the Wasserstein distance at
  exponent one is that area.
