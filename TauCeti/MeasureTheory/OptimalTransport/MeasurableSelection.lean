# Recovering a transport map from Dirac conditional laws

If the conditional laws of the second coordinate of a finite coupling are Dirac for
almost every source point, the coupling is the graph plan of a measurable map with the
prescribed target law. This turns almost-everywhere singleton conditional transport
fibers into a Monge map.
