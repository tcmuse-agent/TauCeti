# Local convergence of mollifications after zero extension

For a subset `t ⊆ s` of a measurable set `s`, extend an `Lᵖ(s)` function by zero to the
ambient space,
average it against a normalized smooth bump, and restrict the result to `t`. As the radius
shrinks, this converges in `Lᵖ(t)` to the original function restricted to `t` whenever
`1 ≤ p < ∞`. The result applies to every Banach-valued field, including all weak derivative
fields of a Sobolev function, and requires no regularity of the boundary of `s`.

This is the local form of the strong approximate-identity theorem. It does not assert that
the zero extension is weakly differentiable across the boundary.
