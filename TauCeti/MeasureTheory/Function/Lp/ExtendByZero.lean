# Extension by zero between restricted `Lᵖ` spaces

An `Lᵖ` function on a measurable set `s` extends by zero to any larger set `t ⊇ s`, and the
extension has the *same* `Lᵖ` norm, because the added region contributes nothing.  This file
bundles that extension as a linear isometry

`TauCeti.extendByZeroLpₗᵢ 𝕜 μ hs hst : Lp F p (μ.restrict s) →ₗᵢ[𝕜] Lp F p (μ.restrict t)`,

together with the almost-everywhere description of its values, `TauCeti.coeFn_extendByZeroLpₗᵢ`.

The one point that needs care is that `Lᵖ` elements are equivalence classes: `s.indicator ⇑f`
depends on the chosen representative `⇑f`, which is only pinned down `μ.restrict s`-almost
everywhere, whereas the answer must be pinned down `μ.restrict t`-almost everywhere.  Mathlib's
`MeasureTheory.ae_eq_restrict_iff_indicator_ae_eq` reconciles the two: an identity holding
`μ.restrict s`-almost everywhere survives multiplication by the indicator of `s` as an identity
against `μ`, hence against every restriction of `μ`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.extendByZeroLpₗᵢ`: extension by zero as a linear isometry.
* `TauCeti.coeFn_extendByZeroLpₗᵢ` and `TauCeti.coeFn_extendByZeroLpₗᵢ_restrict`: the values of
  the extension, on `t` and back on `s`.
* `TauCeti.extendByZeroLpₗᵢ_self` and `TauCeti.extendByZeroLpₗᵢ_extendByZeroLpₗᵢ`: extending
  along `s ⊆ s` is the identity, and extending twice is extending once.
* `TauCeti.extendByZeroLpₗᵢ_eq_of_ae_eq` and `TauCeti.coeFn_extendByZeroLpₗᵢ_comp`: the two ways
  an extension is recognised in practice — from a representative that already vanishes off `s`,
  and through pointwise postcomposition by a map fixing `0`.

/-- **Extension by zero as a linear isometry** `Lᵖ(s) → Lᵖ(t)` for a measurable `s ⊆ t`: a
function on `s` is regarded as a function on the larger set `t` by declaring it zero on `t \ s`.

It is an isometry, not merely a bounded map, because the enlarged region contributes nothing to
the `Lᵖ` norm; in particular the extension is injective, so `Lᵖ(s)` really does sit inside
`Lᵖ(t)`. -/
