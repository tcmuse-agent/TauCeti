# `Lᵖ` convergence implies `L¹` convergence on a finite measure space

On a finite measure space the `Lᵖ` seminorm dominates the `L¹` seminorm up to the factor
`μ(univ)^(1 - 1/p)`, so a sequence converging in `Lᵖ` converges in `L¹`.  Stated with the `L¹`
distance written as a lower Lebesgue integral, which is the form consumed by arguments that pass
an integral identity to a limit.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.tendsto_lintegral_enorm_sub_of_tendsto_Lp`: `Lᵖ` convergence gives
  `∫⁻ ‖f i - g‖ₑ → 0`.
