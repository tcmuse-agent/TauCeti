# Bilinear forms with `L∞` coefficients on `L²`

An essentially bounded field of continuous bilinear forms acts on two square-integrable
functions by pointwise evaluation and integration.  This file packages that operation as a
continuous bilinear form using Mathlib's Hölder multiplication and `Lᵖ` pairing.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.lpBilinearForm`: the continuous bilinear form associated to an `L∞` field.
* `TauCeti.lpBilinearForm_apply`: its integral characterization.
* `TauCeti.lpBilinearForm_congr_ae`: invariance under a.e. equality of coefficient fields.
