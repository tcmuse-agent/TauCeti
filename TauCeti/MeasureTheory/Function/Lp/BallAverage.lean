# The ball average of an `Lᵖ` function

The **ball average** of `f` at scale `r` is

`A_r f x = ⨍ y in Metric.ball x r, f y ∂μ`,

the mean of `f` over the ball of radius `r` centred at `x`. It is the mollification of `f` by the
normalized indicator of a ball, and it is the smoothing operator behind the Fréchet--Kolmogorov
compactness criterion in `Lᵖ`, hence behind Rellich--Kondrachov, Lane A.6 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/PDE/README.md`.

Four estimates are proved here, all for `1 ≤ p < ∞` and an additive Haar measure `μ` on a proper
normed additive group. Writing `V = μ (Metric.ball 0 r)` for the volume of the ball, they are

`‖A_r f x‖ ≤ V ^ (-1/p) ‖f‖_p`,
`‖A_r f (x + e) - A_r f x‖ ≤ V ^ (-1/p) ‖f(· + e) - f‖_p`,
`‖A_r f‖_p ≤ ‖f‖_p`,
`‖A_r f - f‖_p ≤ C` whenever `‖f(· + e) - f‖_p ≤ C` for every `e` in the ball of radius `r`.

For each fixed positive `r`, these estimates send a family with uniformly small `Lᵖ` translation
increments to a uniformly bounded and uniformly equicontinuous family of ball averages. The
equicontinuity bound includes the scale-dependent factor `V ^ (-1/p)`; its remaining modulus is
the original family's uniform `Lᵖ` translation modulus. This is exactly the trade-off that the
Fréchet--Kolmogorov criterion exploits: a family of functions whose translates move little in
`Lᵖ` is uniformly close to a family of uniformly equicontinuous ones.

The first two estimates come from a single Hölder bound,
`TauCeti.enorm_setAverage_le`: the average of `g` over a set `s` of finite positive measure is at
most `μ s ^ (-1/p) ‖g‖_p`. For the first, apply it to `g = f`; for the second, apply it to
`g = f(· + e) - f`, using that the ball average commutes with translation.

The last two are Hölder again, now in the translation variable, followed by Tonelli's theorem;
they share the analytic core `lintegral_enorm_setAverage_rpow_le`. For the contraction, apply it
to `G x e = f (x + e)` and use translation invariance on each slice. For the approximation
estimate, write the deviation as an average,

`A_r f x - f x = ⨍ e in Metric.ball 0 r, (f (x + e) - f x) ∂μ`,

so that its `p`-th power is bounded by `V⁻¹ ∫⁻ e in Metric.ball 0 r, ‖f (x + e) - f x‖ₑ ^ p ∂μ`.
Integrating in `x` and exchanging the two integrations, the inner integral becomes
`‖f(· + e) - f‖_p ^ p`, uniformly at most `C ^ p`, and the factor `V⁻¹` cancels against the
measure of the ball the translation ranges over.

Both the definition and the estimates are stated for a Banach-space-valued `f`. The domain is
assumed proper, which is what makes balls have finite measure; finite-dimensional real normed
spaces are an important special case.

The averages appearing here are the ones the Hardy--Littlewood maximal function
`TauCeti.maximalFunction` takes a supremum of, so `‖A_r f x‖ ≤ M f x` for every `r > 0`. The two
are put to opposite uses: the maximal function discards `r` to get a pointwise majorant of `f`,
while `A_r f` keeps `r` as a smoothing scale and is compared with `f` itself. Nothing below needs
the maximal inequality, so the two developments are kept apart.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.ballAverage`: the ball average, with `TauCeti.ballAverage_congr_ae` and
  `TauCeti.ballAverage_eq_setAverage_ball_zero` as its basic interface.
* `TauCeti.ballAverage_const`: the ball average of a constant is that constant, so the
  normalization is the intended one.
* `TauCeti.enorm_setAverage_rpow_le`, `TauCeti.enorm_setAverage_le`: Hölder's bound on an average
  over a set, in `∫⁻` and in `Lᵖ` form.
* `TauCeti.stronglyMeasurable_ballAverage`: `A_r f` is strongly measurable when `f` is.
* `TauCeti.enorm_ballAverage_le`: the `L^∞` bound on `A_r f`.
* `TauCeti.eLpNorm_ballAverage_le`: `A_r` is an `Lᵖ` contraction.
* `TauCeti.ballAverage_comp_add`, `TauCeti.ballAverage_sub_ballAverage`: the ball average
  commutes with translation, and its increment is the ball average of the increment.
* `TauCeti.enorm_ballAverage_add_sub_ballAverage_le`: the equicontinuity estimate, with modulus
  the `Lᵖ` modulus of continuity of `f` itself.
* `TauCeti.uniformEquicontinuous_ballAverage`: equicontinuity of the ball averages of a family.
* `TauCeti.continuous_ballAverage`, `TauCeti.memLp_ballAverage`: a ball average at positive
  scale is continuous and remains in `Lᵖ`.
* `TauCeti.ballAverage_sub_self`, `TauCeti.eLpNorm_ballAverage_sub_le`: the deviation of `f` from
  its ball average as an average of increments, and the `Lᵖ` approximation estimate.
