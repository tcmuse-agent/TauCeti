# The weight ↔ measure isometry `L²(w·μ) ≃ₗᵢ L²(μ)`

For an almost-everywhere-positive real weight `w` on an arbitrary measurable space, multiplication
by `√w` is a linear isometric equivalence from the weighted `L²` space `L²(w·μ)` onto `L²(μ)`, where
`w·μ := μ.withDensity (ENNReal.ofReal ∘ w)`. It is an *equivalence* precisely because `w > 0`
almost everywhere: the inverse is multiplication by `(√w)⁻¹`.

This is the Part 0 primitive `weightL2Isometry` from the `OrthogonalL2Bases` roadmap, the single
map converting a weight-in-the-measure normalization to a weight-in-the-function normalization. Once
combined with `HilbertBasis.mapₗᵢ` (transport of a Hilbert basis across a `≃ₗᵢ`, already in
`TauCeti.Analysis.InnerProductSpace.HilbertBasis.Map`), it moves an orthogonal-polynomial basis of a
weighted measure to the `√w`-envelope basis of the reference measure and back.

The construction is purely measure-theoretic, so it is stated over an arbitrary `MeasurableSpace`;
only the later polynomial-facing layers specialize to `Measure ℝ`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.weightL2Isometry` — the isometric equivalence `L²(w·μ) ≃ₗᵢ[𝕜] L²(μ)`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.weightL2Isometry_apply` — the forward map is multiplication by `√w`.
* `TauCeti.weightL2Isometry_symm_apply` — the inverse map is multiplication by `(√w)⁻¹`.

The file also provides the underlying `L²` seminorm identity: the `L²(μ)` seminorm of `√w · g`
equals the `L²(w·μ)` seminorm of `g`.

/-- **Core seminorm identity.** The `L²(μ)` seminorm of `√w · g` equals the `L²(w·μ)` seminorm of

nonnegativity of `w` almost everywhere is needed. -/
