# `L²` convergence gives `L¹` convergence on a finite measure space

Mathlib supplies the exponent comparison `eLpNorm_le_eLpNorm_mul_rpow_measure_univ`, which costs a
fixed finite factor `μ univ ^ (1/p - 1/q)`. Packaging it as a statement about *convergence* — and
in the `∫ ‖·‖` form rather than the `eLpNorm` form — is what consumers usually want, and is not in
Mathlib.

Both de Finetti proof routes need it: the mean-ergodic theorem and the `L²` block estimates each
produce `L²` convergence, while the block factorizations consume `L¹` convergence written as an
integral of an absolute difference.

/-- **`L²` convergence implies `L¹` convergence on a finite measure space.** If a family `f` tends
to `0` in `L²` along a filter `l`, then `∫ ‖f i‖` tends to `0` along `l`.

The exponent comparison costs the fixed finite factor `μ univ ^ (1/1 - 1/2)`, which the limit
absorbs. Nothing in the argument constrains the index, the filter, or the codomain beyond having a
norm, so all three are arbitrary; the usual difference form is the instance `f i = W i - a`. -/
