# The absolute Galois group of a field, taken at its separable closure

For a normal extension `E/F` an automorphism of `E` is determined by, and determined on, the
separable closure of `F` in `E`: restriction

```
Gal(E/F) → Gal(separableClosure F E / F)
```

is an isomorphism of topological groups, `TauCeti.separableClosureRestrictEquiv`. Specialised to
`E = AlgebraicClosure F` this identifies Mathlib's `Field.absoluteGaloisGroup F`, defined through
the algebraic closure, with `TauCeti.AbsoluteGaloisGroup F = Gal(SeparableClosure F / F)`, which is
the carrier every Galois-cohomological statement is written against.

Which of the two closures is used is not a matter of taste.
`TauCeti.mem_perfectClosure_iff_fixed` says
that the elements of a normal `E/F` fixed by every `F`-automorphism are exactly the elements purely
inseparable over `F`. So for an imperfect `F` the fixed field of `Field.absoluteGaloisGroup F` is
the purely inseparable closure of `F` and not `F` itself, while over the separable closure
`InfiniteGalois.mem_range_algebraMap_iff_fixed` gives the fixed field `F` that a Galois descent
argument needs. The two groups are nonetheless the same topological group, which is what lets a
property of the group and its topology alone be read off for one from the other.

Only such properties transport along the isomorphism as they stand; a statement mentioning the
extension, its intermediate fields or the action on `E` has to be translated first. Both happen
here. Compactness of a Galois group is transported unchanged, so `Gal(E/F)` is profinite for `E/F`
merely normal. The fundamental theorem is translated: the closed subgroups of `Gal(E/F)` are the
fixing subgroups, and they correspond to the intermediate fields of `separableClosure F E / F`.
Intermediate fields of `E` outside the separable closure are not seen by any fixing subgroup, by
`IntermediateField.fixingSubgroup_inf_separableClosure`, which is why the correspondence is
indexed by the separable closure.

## Main definitions and results

* `TauCeti.AbsoluteGaloisGroup K`: the automorphisms of a separable closure of `K`.
* `TauCeti.separableClosureRestrictEquiv`: restriction to the separable closure is an isomorphism
  of topological groups, for any normal extension.
* `TauCeti.absoluteGaloisGroupRestrictEquiv`: its specialisation comparing
  `Field.absoluteGaloisGroup K` with `TauCeti.AbsoluteGaloisGroup K`.
* `TauCeti.fixingSubgroup_fixedField`: every closed subgroup is a fixing subgroup.
* `TauCeti.intermediateFieldEquivClosedSubgroup`: the fundamental theorem of Galois theory for a
  normal extension.
* `TauCeti.mem_perfectClosure_iff_fixed`: the fixed field of `Gal(E/F)` for a normal
  extension `E/F` is the relative perfect closure of `F` in `E`.

This is the criterion the inverse of `separableClosureRestrictEquiv` is checked against, and it is
where the topologies are compared: the fixing subgroup of a finite subextension `M` of `E` is
pulled back to the fixing subgroup of `M ∩ separableClosure F E`, which by
`IntermediateField.fixingSubgroup_inf_separableClosure` cuts out the same automorphisms of `E`
as `M` does. -/

/-! ### The absolute Galois group -/

variable (K : Type*) [Field K]

/-- The absolute Galois group of `K`: the group of automorphisms of a separable closure of `K`.

This, rather than Mathlib's `Field.absoluteGaloisGroup`, is the group Galois cohomology is stated
at, because it is `Kˢ` and not an algebraic closure whose invariants are `K` for every `K`. It is
an abbreviation so that the Krull topology, the profinite structure and the action on `Kˢ` are the
ones Mathlib already provides for `Gal(E/F)`; `absoluteGaloisGroupRestrictEquiv` compares it with
`Field.absoluteGaloisGroup`. -/
abbrev AbsoluteGaloisGroup := Gal(SeparableClosure K/K)

/-- **Mathlib's absolute Galois group and `AbsoluteGaloisGroup` are the same topological group**:
restricting an automorphism of an algebraic closure of `K` to the separable closure is an
isomorphism `Field.absoluteGaloisGroup K ≃ₜ* AbsoluteGaloisGroup K`.

Its forward map is restriction, `absoluteGaloisGroupRestrictEquiv_apply`, and both directions are
computed on elements of `SeparableClosure K` by `coe_absoluteGaloisGroupRestrictEquiv_apply` and
`absoluteGaloisGroupRestrictEquiv_symm_apply_coe`. Those lemmas are stated on applications rather
than on the isomorphisms themselves, because `Field.absoluteGaloisGroup K` carries its own derived
group and topology instances, so an equation between the isomorphisms is not usable by `rw`.
