# The different exponent of a place

Let `F' / k'` be an extension of the field extension `F / k` in which `F' / F` is finite and
separable, and let `P'` be a place of `F' / k'` lying over the place `P = P'.restrict k F` of
`F / k`.  Stichtenoth attaches to that pair the **different exponent** `d(P' ∣ P)`, read off the
complementary module of the local extension `𝒪_P ⊆ 𝒪'_P`, where `𝒪_P` is the valuation ring of `P`
and `𝒪'_P` its integral closure in `F'`.  This file defines it and proves the two facts that make
it a divisor-theoretic invariant: **Dedekind's different theorem**, `d(P' ∣ P) ≥ e(P' ∣ P) - 1`,
and the vanishing criterion that singles out the unramified places.

The complementary module `C_P = {z | Tr_{F'/F} (z · 𝒪'_P) ⊆ 𝒪_P}` is an invertible fractional
`𝒪'_P`-ideal whose inverse is Mathlib's `differentIdeal 𝒪_P 𝒪'_P`, so Stichtenoth's `-v_{P'}(t)`
for a generator `t` of `C_P` is the multiplicity of the centre of `P'` on `𝒪'_P` in that ideal.
That multiplicity is the definition used here, and no complementary module is rebuilt.

The local model `𝒪_P ⊆ 𝒪'_P` is a pair of affine models in the sense of
`TauCeti/FieldTheory/FunctionField/AffineModel/`, the smallest one that sees `P`: `𝒪_P` is a
discrete valuation ring with fraction field `F`, and `𝒪'_P` is a Dedekind domain, module-finite
over it, with fraction field `F'`.  It is constructed in
`TauCeti/FieldTheory/FunctionField/Place/Extension/Basic.lean`; the action of `𝒪_P` on `F'`
and the scalar tower it sits in are deliberately not global instances, so they are reinstalled
here as `local` instances.  The identification of the extension-theoretic data of `P'` with the
ideal-theoretic data of its centre on `𝒪'_P` is then the affine-model dictionary of
`TauCeti/FieldTheory/FunctionField/AffineModel/Extension.lean`.

Separability of `F' / F` is the hypothesis of record for the different: without it the
complementary module degenerates.  Nothing here needs an exactness hypothesis on the constant
fields, and nothing needs `k` perfect.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Place.centerIntegralClosure`: the centre of `P'` on the local model `𝒪'_P`.
* `TauCeti.Place.differentExponent`: the different exponent `d(P' ∣ P)` (Stichtenoth,
  Definition 3.4.3).

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Place.center_restrict_asIdeal_eq_maximalIdeal`: the prime of `𝒪_P` below the centre of
  `P'` on the local model is the maximal ideal of `𝒪_P`, so the residue extension the different
  exponent reads is the residue-field extension of the two places.
* `TauCeti.Place.pow_dvd_differentIdeal_iff_le_differentExponent`: the characteristic property of
  the different exponent, `𝔓'^n ∣ differentIdeal 𝒪_P 𝒪'_P ↔ n ≤ d(P' ∣ P)`.
* `TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdx_le_differentExponent_add_one`: **Dedekind's different theorem**
  (Stichtenoth, Theorem 3.5.1(a)), in the subtraction-free form `e(P' ∣ P) ≤ d(P' ∣ P) + 1`.
* `TauCeti.Place.differentExponent_pos_of_one_lt_ramificationIdx`: a ramified place has positive
  different exponent — the direction of Stichtenoth's Corollary 3.5.5 that needs no hypothesis on
  the residue extension.
* `TauCeti.Place.differentExponent_eq_zero_iff`: the different exponent vanishes exactly at the
  places where the local model is unramified, in Mathlib's `Algebra.IsUnramifiedAt` sense, which
  asks for a separable residue extension as well as `e(P' ∣ P) = 1`.
* `TauCeti.Place.differentIdeal_eq_top_of_ord_discr_eq_zero` and
  `TauCeti.Place.differentExponent_eq_zero_of_ord_discr_eq_zero`: the different ideal of the local
  model, and hence the different exponent above `P`, is trivial as soon as some `F`-basis of `F'`
  is integral at `P` with unit discriminant there.
