# Affine models of an extension: the fundamental identity

Let `F' / k'` be a finite extension of the field extension `F / k`, let `R` be an affine model of
`F / k` and let `S` be an affine model of `F' / k'` that is an `R`-algebra: a pair of charts of the
two curves, compatible with the covering map. This file identifies the extension-theoretic data of
a place of `F' / k'` finite on `S` with Mathlib's ideal-theoretic data of its centre, and deduces
the **fundamental identity** `∑_{P' ∣ P} e(P' ∣ P) · f(P' ∣ P) = [F' : F]` at every place of the
finite chart, supplying the inequality of
`TauCeti/FieldTheory/FunctionField/Place/Extension/Fibre.lean` with its converse.

The dictionary is exact at each of the three items. The centre on `S` of a place of `F' / k'` lies
over the centre on `R` of the place of `F / k` it restricts to; the ramification index `e(P' ∣ P)`,
defined as the factor by which the order function scales, is `Ideal.ramificationIdx`, because
Mathlib's `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.valuation_liesOver` scales the adic valuations by
exactly that factor; and the relative degree `f(P' ∣ P) = [F'_{P'} : F_P]` is `Ideal.inertiaDeg`,
because the residue field of a place finite on a model is the model modulo the centre, compatibly
on both levels. Summing over the fibre is then Mathlib's
`Ideal.sum_ramification_inertia_eq_finrank` for the finite extension of Dedekind domains `S / R`,
transported to the fraction fields.

The identity is stated at the place of a height one prime of `R`; the places outside the finite
chart of `R` are reached by the same statement at a second model, as in Stichtenoth's two-chart
device.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Place.restrictOfPrimeEquivPrimesOver`: the places of `F' / k'` lying over the place of a
  height one prime `𝔭` of `R` are exactly the primes of `S` lying over `𝔭`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Place.center_liesOver`: the centre on `S` of a place of `F' / k'` finite on `S` lies
  over the centre on `R` of its restriction to `F`.
* `TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdx_eq_ramificationIdx_center` and
  `TauCeti.Place.relativeDegree_eq_inertiaDeg_center`: the two bridge lemmas
  `e(P' ∣ P) = Ideal.ramificationIdx` and `f(P' ∣ P) = Ideal.inertiaDeg`, with
  `TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdx_ofPrime` and `TauCeti.Place.relativeDegree_ofPrime` their forms at
  the place of a height one prime of `S`.
* `TauCeti.Place.restrict_ofPrime`: the place of a prime `𝔓` of `S` lies over the place of a prime
  `𝔭` of `R` as soon as `𝔓` lies over `𝔭`.
* `TauCeti.Place.sum_ramificationIdx_mul_relativeDegree_eq_finrank`: **the fundamental identity**
  (Stichtenoth, Theorem 3.1.11) at a place of the finite chart.
