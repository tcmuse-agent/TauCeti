# Affine models: a place finite on a Dedekind subring is one of its height one primes

An *affine model* of `F / k` is a Dedekind `k`-subalgebra `R` of `F` whose fraction field is `F`;
the standard example is the integral closure `R_x` of `k[x]` in `F` for a transcendental `x`. This
file proves the forward direction of the places ↔ height one primes correspondence: a place of
`F / k` whose valuation ring contains `R` is the adic place of a *unique* height one prime `𝔭` of
`R`, in the strong sense that the valuation of the place *equals* — not merely is equivalent to —
the normalized `𝔭`-adic valuation. The prime in question is the centre `{r : R | ord_P r > 0}` of
the place on `R`, so the valuation ring of the place is the localization of `R` there. The converse
— that every height one prime of `R` arises this way, which upgrades this injection into a
bijection — is not proved here; it is proved in
`TauCeti/FieldTheory/FunctionField/AffineModel/Prime.lean`, which constructs the place of a
prime.

This is the "places → height one primes" half of the affine-model dictionary that reduces divisor
theory on the finite chart of a model to Mathlib's factorization calculus for fractional ideals.
Which places are finite on `R_x` is settled by the two order-of-`x` criteria below: `k[x]` lies in
the valuation ring of `P` exactly when `x` has no pole at `P`, and the valuation ring, being
integrally closed, then swallows everything integral over `k[x]`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Place.adjoin_le_integers_iff`: `k[x] ⊆ 𝒪_P` exactly when `x ∈ 𝒪_P`.
* `TauCeti.Place.center`: the height one prime of an affine model below a place finite on it,
  with `TauCeti.Place.valuation_center` identifying the adic valuation of that prime with the
  valuation of the place, `TauCeti.Place.center_injective` showing that a place finite on a
  model is determined by its centre, and `TauCeti.Place.comap_center_asIdeal` showing that the
  centre on a larger model contracts to the centre on a smaller one.
* `TauCeti.Place.existsUnique_valuation_eq`: the uniqueness statement, and
  `TauCeti.Place.valuationSubringAtPrime_eq_integers`: the valuation ring of the place is the
  localization of the model at the centre.
* `TauCeti.Place.ord_algebraMap_eq_multiplicity_center`: the coefficient formula
  `ord_P r = mult_(centre) (r)`, which reads an order at the place off the factorization of an
  ideal of the model.
