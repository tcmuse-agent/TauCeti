# Nonvanishing of local components of Weil differentials

Every local component of a nonzero Weil differential on an algebraic function field with exact
constants is nonzero.  Consequently, fixing any one place `P`, the map `ω ↦ ω_P` is injective on
the space of Weil differentials: one local component determines the global differential.

The key point is that allowing a double pole at `P` strictly enlarges the space of regular Weil
differentials.  Indeed,

`dim_k Ω_F(-2P) = 2 deg P - 1 + g > g = dim_k Ω_F(0)`.

Thus some differential in `Ω_F(-2P)` is not regular.  Its local component at `P` cannot vanish,
because the local-component characterization of the filtration would then make it regular after
all.  Since the full space of Weil differentials is one-dimensional over `F`, multiplication by a
function carries this witness to any prescribed nonzero differential, and multiplication cannot
create a zero local component.

This is the nonvanishing assertion and the final clause of Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields
and Codes*, 2nd ed., Proposition 1.7.3(a).  It is the local input for defining the order of a Weil
differential and for comparing Weil differentials with Kähler differentials through residues.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.repartitionDualComponent_ne_zero`: over an exact constant field, every local component
  of a nonzero Weil differential is nonzero.
* `TauCeti.repartitionDualComponent_eq_zero_iff`: over an exact constant field, a Weil differential
  is zero exactly when its local component at one fixed place is zero.
* `TauCeti.repartitionDualComponent_inj`: over an exact constant field, two Weil differentials are
  equal exactly when their local components at one fixed place are equal.

/-- At every place of an algebraic function field with exact constants, some Weil differential
has a nonzero local component.

The witness can be taken from `Ω_F(-2P)`: this space has dimension
`2 * deg P - 1 + g`, strictly larger than the `g`-dimensional space `Ω_F(0)` of regular
differentials. -/
