# The fundamental identity at an arbitrary place

Let `F' / k'` be an extension of the field extension `F / k` in which `F' / F` is finite; of the
constant fields only integrality of `k' / k` is asked.  This file proves **the fundamental
identity**

`∑_{P' ∣ P} e(P' ∣ P) · f(P' ∣ P) = [F' : F]`

at **every** place `P` of `F / k`, upgrading the inequality of
`TauCeti/FieldTheory/FunctionField/Place/Extension/Fibre.lean` and removing the restriction of
`TauCeti/FieldTheory/FunctionField/AffineModel/Extension.lean` to the places of a chosen finite
chart.  It is proved in two forms, with incomparable hypotheses: for `F' / F` separable, and for
`F / k` an algebraic function field with no separability.

Both reduce to the affine-model identity, which needs an affine model of `F` carrying `P` whose
integral closure in `F'` is a finite module over it — the hypothesis of Mathlib's
`Ideal.sum_ramification_inertia_eq_finrank`.

* For `F' / F` separable, the model is the valuation ring `𝒪_P` itself, a discrete valuation ring
  with fraction field `F`: separability makes its integral closure in `F'` a finite
  `𝒪_P`-module, by Mathlib's `IsIntegralClosure.finite`.  No hypothesis on `F / k` is used.  The
  local model is the one set up in `TauCeti/FieldTheory/FunctionField/Place/Extension/Basic.lean`;
  the action of `𝒪_P` on `F'` and the scalar tower it sits in are not global instances, so they
  are reinstalled here.
* For `F / k` a function field, the model is the integral closure `R_t` of `k[t]` in `F` for a
  uniformizer `t` at `P`.  As `t` has no pole at `P`, the place `P` lies on the finite chart of
  `R_t`; as `t` is transcendental, the integral closure of `k[t]` in the finite extension `F'` of
  `k(t)` is a finite `k[t]`-module with no separability hypothesis
  (`TauCeti.IsIntegralClosure.finite_adjoin_of_transcendental`), hence a finite `R_t`-module.
  The valuation ring `𝒪_P` is not used as the model in this case: the integral closure of a
  discrete valuation ring in an inseparable extension need not be finite in general, and it is
  the finiteness of the normalization of `k[t]` that supplies finiteness here.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Place.sum_ramificationIdx_mul_relativeDegree_eq_finrank_of_isSeparable`: the
  fundamental identity at an arbitrary place, for a separable extension (Stichtenoth,
  Theorem 3.1.11).
* `TauCeti.Place.sum_ramificationIdx_mul_relativeDegree_eq_finrank_of_isFunctionField`: the
  fundamental identity at an arbitrary place of an algebraic function field, for any finite
  extension (Stichtenoth, Theorem 3.1.11, which assumes no separability).

/-- **The fundamental identity** (Stichtenoth, Theorem 3.1.11) at an arbitrary place `P` of
`F / k`, for an extension `F' / k'` whose extension of function fields `F' / F` is finite and
**separable**: the ramification indices and relative degrees of the places of `F' / k'` lying
over `P` satisfy `∑_{P' ∣ P} e(P' ∣ P) · f(P' ∣ P) = [F' : F]`.

The finite set `s` is the fibre of `TauCeti.Place.restrict` over `P`, which is finite by
`TauCeti.Place.finite_setOf_restrict_eq`.

Separability is the hypothesis of Mathlib's finiteness theorem for integral closures, and is used
only there. When `F / k` is an algebraic function field the identity holds for every finite
extension; that is
`TauCeti.Place.sum_ramificationIdx_mul_relativeDegree_eq_finrank_of_isFunctionField`. -/
