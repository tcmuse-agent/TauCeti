# Extensions of places: the ramification index and the relative degree

Let `F' / k'` be a field extension lying over `F / k`, with `F'` algebraic over `F`. Restricting
the valuation of a place `P'` of `F' / k'` to `F` gives a valuation of `F` that is trivial on the
constants and — because `F'` is algebraic over `F`, so that a valuation ring of `F'` containing
`F` would be all of `F'` — nontrivial. Normalizing it produces a place `P = P'.restrict k F` of
`F / k`, the place of `F` that `P'` *lies over*, and the index divided out in the normalization
is the **ramification index** `e(P' | P)`. The residue field of `P` embeds in the residue field
of `P'`, and the degree of that extension is the **relative degree** `f(P' | P)`.

The constant field may grow along with `F`: if `k'` is integral over `k` then a valuation of `F'`
is trivial on `k` exactly when it is trivial on `k'`, so the places of `F' / k` and of `F' / k'`
are literally the same objects. That is `TauCeti.Place.constantsEquiv`, which lets a place of
`F' / k'` be produced from data that only sees the smaller constant field `k`.

The main theorem is the bound `e(P' | P) · f(P' | P) ≤ [F' : F]`: residues of elements of `𝒪_{P'}`
that are independent over `F_P`, multiplied by the powers `t^j` of a prime element for `P'` with
`0 ≤ j < e`, are independent over `F`, because the orders of the resulting blocks are pairwise
distinct modulo `e`.

The file also records the action of the valuation ring `𝒪_P` of a place `P` of `F / k` on the
extension field `F'`, through `F`.  That action is not a global instance — for `F' = F` it would
compete with the action of a valuation subring on its own field — so it, and the scalar tower it
sits in, are provided to be reinstalled by consumers with `attribute [local instance 10]`.
For a finite extension, it also records the standard local integral-closure model
`𝒪_P ⊆ 𝒪'_P`: `F'` is the fraction field and the localization of `𝒪'_P` at `(𝒪_P)⁰`; for a
separable extension, `𝒪'_P` is Dedekind and module-finite over `𝒪_P`, and separability transports
to the canonical fraction fields used by Mathlib's different API.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Place.constantsEquiv`: the places of `F' / k` are the places of `F' / k'`, for `k'`
  integral over `k`; enlarging the constants by an algebraic extension changes nothing.
* `TauCeti.Place.algebraIntegersExtension` and `TauCeti.Place.isScalarTowerIntegersExtension`: the
  action of the valuation ring of a place of `F / k` on an extension field `F'`, to be installed
  with `attribute [local instance 10]`.
* `TauCeti.Place.restrict`: the place of `F / k` that a place of `F' / k'` lies over.
* `TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdx`: the ramification index `e(P' | P)`.
* `TauCeti.Place.relativeDegree`: the relative degree `f(P' | P) = [F'_{P'} : F_P]`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Place.ord_algebraMap_restrict`: the defining property `ord_{P'} = e · ord_P` on `F`.
* `TauCeti.Place.restrict_eq_iff_integers_le`, `TauCeti.Place.restrict_eq_iff_forall_ord_pos`
  and `TauCeti.Place.restrict_eq_iff_exists_ord_eq`: the three characterizations of `P' ∣ P`
  (Stichtenoth, Proposition 3.1.4), by the containment of valuation rings, by the containment of
  maximal ideals, and by the scaling of the order functions. Together with
  `TauCeti.Place.restrict` they say that every place of `F'` lies over exactly one place of `F`.
* `TauCeti.Place.restrict_eq_iff_isEquiv_comap`: `P' ∣ P` exactly when the restricted valuation
  is equivalent to that of `P`.
* `TauCeti.Place.linearIndependent_mul_pow_of_linearIndependent_residue`: the independence
  statement carrying the fundamental inequality, together with the three ingredients of its
  proof — `TauCeti.Place.ord_sum_eq_zero_of_isUnit`,
  `TauCeti.Place.sum_ne_zero_of_linearIndependent_residue` and
  `TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdx_dvd_ord_sum_of_linearIndependent_residue` — and the
  ultrametric estimate `TauCeti.Place.sum_ne_zero_of_ord_eq_mul_add_natCast` with
  `TauCeti.Place.ord_sum_le_of_ord_eq_mul_add_natCast` that combines them.
* `TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdx_mul_relativeDegree_le_finrank`: `e(P' ∣ P) · f(P' ∣ P) ≤
  [F' : F]`, with `TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdx_le_finrank` and
  `TauCeti.Place.relativeDegree_le_finrank` its two halves (Stichtenoth, Corollary 3.1.12).
* `TauCeti.Place.finiteDimensional_residueField_restrict`: the relative degree is finite, so it
  is not the junk value of `Module.finrank`; `TauCeti.Place.one_le_relativeDegree` and
  `TauCeti.Place.ramificationIdx_pos` are the matching lower bounds.
* `TauCeti.Place.finrank_mul_degree_eq_relativeDegree_mul_degree_restrict`:
  `[k' : k] · deg P' = f(P' ∣ P) · deg P`, the comparison of the degrees of `P'` and of the place
  it lies over.
* `TauCeti.Place.isFractionRing_integralClosure`,
  `TauCeti.Place.isLocalization_integralClosure`,
  `TauCeti.Place.isDedekindDomain_integralClosure`,
  `TauCeti.Place.moduleFinite_integralClosure`, and
  `TauCeti.Place.isSeparable_fractionRing_integralClosure`: the fraction-field, localization,
  Dedekind, finiteness, and separability properties of the local integral closure `𝒪'_P`.
* `TauCeti.Place.isIntegral_algebraMap_iff_mem_integers`: the local integral closure `𝒪'_P`
  contracts to `𝒪_P`.
