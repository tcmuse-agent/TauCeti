# The ideal class group of an affine model of a function field

`TauCeti.FieldTheory.FunctionField.RiemannRoch.ClassNumber` proves that the degree-zero divisor
class group `Cl⁰(F)` of an algebraic function field with a *finite* constant field is finite, and
`TauCeti.FieldTheory.FunctionField.Divisor.AffineModel` exhibits the ideal class group of an
affine model `R` of `F / k` as a quotient of the full divisor class group,

`⟨[P] : P ∤ R⟩ → Cl(F) → ClassGroup R → 0`.

This file joins the two: **the ideal class group of every affine model of an algebraic function
field with a finite constant field is finite.**

The transfer is not immediate, because `Cl(F)` itself is infinite — the degree map
`deg : Cl(F) → ℤ` has finite kernel `Cl⁰(F)` but nonzero image.  What kills the degree is that a
model always has a place `P` at infinity (`TauCeti.Place.exists_algebraMap_notMem_integers`),
whose class dies in `ClassGroup R`.  Correcting a preimage by a multiple of `[P]` therefore moves
its degree into `[0, deg P)` without changing its image, so `ClassGroup R` is the image of the
divisor classes of degree `0, …, deg P − 1`, of which there are finitely many because each degree
fibre is empty or a coset of the finite group `Cl⁰(F)`.

Only the finiteness of `Cl⁰(F)` enters, so that is the hypothesis the general results below take;
over a finite constant field `TauCeti.Divisor.finite_ker_degreeClass` supplies it, which is what
`TauCeti.Divisor.finite_classGroup_of_finite` records.

There is no separability hypothesis and no chosen rational subfield: `R` is any Dedekind
`k`-subalgebra of `F` with fraction field `F`.  Mathlib's
`FunctionField.RingOfIntegers.instFintypeClassGroup` is the special case where `R` is the
integral closure of `𝔽_q[X]` in `F`, and it is proved by a different route (Minkowski-style
counting through `ClassGroup.fintypeOfAdmissibleOfFinite`) under the extra hypothesis that `F` is
separable over `𝔽_q(X)`.

`TauCeti.FieldTheory.FunctionField.RiemannRoch.RatFunc` runs the bridge on the rational function
field and its model `k[X]`, where it gives `Cl⁰(k(x)) = 0` and the class number `h = 1`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Divisor.finite_classGroup`: **the ideal class group of an affine model of an algebraic
  function field with a finite degree-zero class group is finite**; over a finite constant field
  this is the affine half of Stichtenoth's Proposition 5.1.3.
* `TauCeti.Divisor.finite_classGroup_of_finite`: that specialization, with the finiteness of
  `Cl⁰(F)` supplied by `TauCeti.Divisor.finite_ker_degreeClass`.
* `TauCeti.Divisor.card_classGroup_dvd_classNumber`: when some place infinite on the model is
  rational, the class number of the model divides the class number of `F / k`.

/-- **The ideal class group of an affine model of an algebraic function field with a finite
degree-zero divisor class group is finite** — over a finite constant field, where
`TauCeti.Divisor.finite_ker_degreeClass` supplies `hker`, this is the affine half of Stichtenoth's
Proposition 5.1.3.  Every ideal class of the model comes from a divisor class whose degree lies in
`[0, deg P)` for a place `P` at infinity
(`TauCeti.Divisor.exists_degreeClass_mem_Ico_and_classGroupHom_eq`), and only finitely many
divisor classes have degree in that range.

No separability hypothesis and no chosen rational subfield are needed: `R` is an arbitrary
Dedekind `k`-subalgebra of `F` with fraction field `F`. -/
