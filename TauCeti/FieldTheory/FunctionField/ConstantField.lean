# The constant field of an algebraic function field

The *field of constants* of an algebraic function field `F / k` is the relative algebraic closure
`algebraicClosure k F` of `k` in `F`: the elements of `F` that are algebraic over `k`. This file
proves that it is a finite extension of `k`, records the dictionary for the hypothesis that it is
no larger than `k` (the literature's "`k` is the full field of constants"), and shows that
replacing `k` by the field of constants normalizes any function field to one whose field of
constants is exact.

It then follows the field of constants along a change of the base field.  An intermediate base
field `k'` of `F / k` — one over which `F` is again a function field, which by
`TauCeti.isFunctionField_base_iff_isAlgebraic` means exactly that `k' / k` is algebraic — is
automatically finite over `k`, and as soon as `k'` is its own field of constants it *is* the
field of constants of `F / k`.  In the tower of an extension `F' / k'` of `F / k`, the field of
constants of `F' / k'` cuts down along `F ⊆ F'` to the field of constants of `F / k`; when both
bases are exact this says that `k' ∩ F = k`, so the tower map `k → k'` is the induced inclusion
of the two fields of constants.  The base extension `k' / k` is always algebraic, and finite
once `F' / F` is — a theorem, not a hypothesis, and the finiteness that makes the factor
`[k' : k]` in the conorm degree identity and in the Hurwitz genus formula meaningful.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.finiteDimensional_of_isAlgebraic`: an intermediate extension of a
  function field `F / k` which is algebraic over `k` is finite over `k`.
* `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.finiteDimensional_algebraicClosure`: the field of constants of a
  function field is finite over the base field.
* `TauCeti.algebraicClosure_eq_bot_iff_isIntegrallyClosedIn`,
  `TauCeti.isIntegrallyClosedIn_iff_forall_isAlgebraic`,
  `TauCeti.isIntegrallyClosedIn_iff_finrank_algebraicClosure_eq_one`: the three faces of the
  exactness hypothesis on the field of constants.
* `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.algebraicClosure` and
  `TauCeti.isIntegrallyClosedIn_algebraicClosure`: `F` is a function field over its field of
  constants, and there the field of constants is exact; the two are packaged as
  `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.exists_intermediateField_isIntegrallyClosedIn`.
* `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.finiteDimensional_base` and
  `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.algebraicClosure_eq_restrictScalars_bot`: an intermediate base field
  of `F / k` is finite over `k`, and is the field of constants of `F / k` as soon as it is its
  own; `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.isAlgebraic_iff_mem_range_algebraMap` is the elementwise form.
* `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.isAlgebraic_baseExtension` and
  `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.finiteDimensional_baseExtension`: in an extension `F' / k'` of
  `F / k`, the base extension `k' / k` is algebraic, and finite once `F' / F` is (Stichtenoth,
  Definition 3.1.1).
* `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.isAlgebraic_algebraMap_iff_isAlgebraic`: the field of constants of
  `F' / k'` cuts down along `F ⊆ F'` to the field of constants of `F / k`; for exact bases
  `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.algebraMap_mem_range_algebraMap_iff` reads this as `k' ∩ F = k`.
* `TauCeti.algebraicClosure_ratFunc`: `k` is the field of constants of `k(x)`.

/-- An algebraic function field is a function field over its own field of constants, and by

This is the device that lets a statement needing an exact field of constants be applied to an
arbitrary function field. -/

base field, an algebraic function field with an exact field of constants. Results stated under
the exactness hypothesis can therefore be applied to a general function field through this. -/

a base field. -/

`F` is a constant of `F' / k'` exactly when it is already a constant of `F / k`: inside `F'` the

/-- **The base field of an extension of function fields is a finite extension of the base field

finiteness that makes the factor `[k' : k]` of the conorm degree identity and of the Hurwitz
genus formula meaningful.

Unlike `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.isAlgebraic_baseExtension`, this does need `F' / F` to be finite
and not merely algebraic: for an algebraic closure `k'` of a finite field `k`, the extension
`k'(x) / k(x)` is algebraic while `k' / k` is infinite. -/
