# Elliptic function fields

An algebraic function field `F / k` is *elliptic* when it has genus one and carries a divisor of
degree one.  The degree-one divisor belongs to the definition and is not a consequence of the
genus: it is what Riemann–Roch converts into a place of degree one, and nothing about a
genus-one function field over a general constant field produces one.

This file proves the basic dictionary of an elliptic function field over an exact constant
field.  A divisor of degree one is linearly equivalent to exactly one place of degree one, so an
elliptic function field has a place of degree one; and once a place `P₀` of degree one is
chosen, `P ↦ [P - P₀]` is a bijection from the places of degree one onto the degree-zero divisor
class group `Cl⁰(F)`.  The addition of `Cl⁰(F)` transported along that bijection is the
intrinsic group law of the degree-one places: it makes the bijection an isomorphism of groups,
and `P ⊕ Q = R` exactly when the divisors `P + Q` and `R + P₀` are linearly equivalent.  The
transported group depends on the choice of `P₀`, so it is a definition, not an instance.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsEllipticFunctionField`: genus one together with a divisor of degree one.
* `TauCeti.Place.degreeOneEquivDegreeZeroClassGroup`: the bijection `P ↦ [P - P₀]` from the
  degree-one places of a genus-one function field onto `Cl⁰(F)`.
* `TauCeti.Place.degreeOneAddCommGroup` and
  `TauCeti.Place.degreeOneAddEquivDegreeZeroClassGroup`: the addition of `Cl⁰(F)` transported
  along that bijection, and the bijection read as an isomorphism of groups.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Divisor.exists_linearlyEquivalent_ofPoint_of_genus_eq_one` and
  `TauCeti.Place.eq_of_linearlyEquivalent_ofPoint_of_genus_eq_one`: in genus one a divisor of
  degree one is linearly equivalent to exactly one place of degree one.
* `TauCeti.IsEllipticFunctionField.exists_place_degree_eq_one`: an elliptic function field has
  a place of degree one;
  `TauCeti.isEllipticFunctionField_iff_genus_eq_one_and_exists_place_degree_eq_one` is the
  converse.
* `TauCeti.Place.degreeOneAddCommGroup_add_eq_iff`: the group law of the degree-one places,
  `P ⊕ Q = R ↔ P + Q ∼ R + P₀`.

/-- An **elliptic function field** (Stichtenoth, Definition 6.1.1): this predicate records the
two conditions of the definition, genus one and the existence of a divisor of degree one.

Being an algebraic function field is *not* part of the predicate: the hypothesis
`TauCeti.IsFunctionField`, like the exactness of the constant field, is kept as a separate
hypothesis on the statements that need it, as everywhere in this development. -/

the prime divisor of a place of degree one. -/
