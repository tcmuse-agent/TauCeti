# Hyperelliptic function fields

An algebraic function field `F / k` is *hyperelliptic* when it has genus at least two and
contains a rational subfield `k(x)` of index two over which it is separable.  Separability is
part of the definition rather than a consequence of it: over a constant field of characteristic
two an index-two subfield can be inseparable, and no standing hypothesis of this development
rules that out.  Away from characteristic two it is automatic, by
`TauCeti.Algebra.isSeparable_of_finrank_eq_two`.

The content of this file is the *intrinsic* description of that subfield, which mentions no
element of `F` at all: `F` is hyperelliptic exactly when its genus is at least two and some
divisor of degree two has `ℓ(A) ≥ 2`.  One direction is the pole divisor `(x)_∞` of the
index-two generator, whose Riemann--Roch space contains `1` and `x`.  The other moves `A` inside
its class to an effective divisor `B`, picks a function `x ∈ L(B)` outside the constants — which
positivity of `ℓ(B)` over the line of constants provides — and reads `[F : k(x)] = deg (x)_∞`
off the product formula: the pole divisor of `x` is dominated by `B`, so the degree is at most
two, and it is not one because a rational function field has genus zero.

In genus two the canonical divisor is such an `A`, since `deg W = 2g - 2 = 2` and `ℓ(W) = g = 2`;
so every function field of genus two has an index-two rational subfield, and away from
characteristic two every function field of genus two is hyperelliptic.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsHyperellipticFunctionField`: genus at least two together with a separable rational
  subfield of index two.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_transcendental_finrank_adjoin_eq_two_of_degree_eq_two`: a divisor of degree two
  with `ℓ ≥ 2` produces a rational subfield of index two; no hypothesis on the characteristic.
* `TauCeti.isHyperellipticFunctionField_iff_two_le_genus_and_exists_degree_eq_two_and_two_le_dim`:
  the intrinsic characterization, away from characteristic two.
* `TauCeti.exists_transcendental_finrank_adjoin_eq_two_of_genus_eq_two` and
  `TauCeti.isHyperellipticFunctionField_of_genus_eq_two`: genus two gives an index-two rational
  subfield, and away from characteristic two makes `F` hyperelliptic.

/-- A **hyperelliptic function field** (Stichtenoth, Definition 6.2.1, with separability of the
index-two subextension made part of the definition): genus at least two together with an element
`x` transcendental over `k` such that `F / k(x)` is separable of degree two.

Being an algebraic function field is *not* part of the predicate: the hypothesis
`TauCeti.IsFunctionField`, like the exactness of the constant field, is kept as a separate
hypothesis on the statements that need it, as everywhere in this development.

In characteristic two an index-two subextension can be purely inseparable, and such an `F` is
deliberately outside this model class; away from characteristic two the separability clause is
automatic, so there the predicate agrees with Stichtenoth's index-two definition. -/

/-! ### From a divisor of degree two to the index-two subfield -/

/-- **A divisor of degree two whose Riemann--Roch space has dimension at least two produces a
rational subfield of index two**, as soon as the genus is positive.

No hypothesis on the characteristic is made, and no separability is claimed: this is the part of
Stichtenoth's Section VI.2 dictionary that holds over an arbitrary constant field.  The genus
hypothesis cannot be dropped: over a rational function field the subfield produced would be all
of `F`. -/
