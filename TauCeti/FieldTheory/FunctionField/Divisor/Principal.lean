# Principal divisors of an algebraic function field

The **principal divisor** of a nonzero function `z` of an algebraic function field `F / k` is the
finite formal sum

`div z = ∑_P ord_P z · P`

of its zeros and poles, weighted by their orders.  It is a finite sum because a function of an
algebraic function field has only finitely many zeros and poles
(`TauCeti.Place.finite_setOf_ord_ne_zero`), and it is additive in `z` because `ord_P` is.  This
file constructs it, splits it into its zero and pole divisors, and characterizes the functions
with trivial divisor as the constants.  It is Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and
Codes*, 2nd ed., Definition 1.4.2.  Its consequences for Riemann–Roch spaces are
`TauCeti.FieldTheory.FunctionField.RiemannRoch.Principal`.

The formal side is not rebuilt: the group `Divisor k F` and its degree are
`TauCeti.FieldTheory.FunctionField.Divisor.Basic`, and the passage from a family of order
functions to principal divisors, the subgroup they form, and linear equivalence is the
existing `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.WeilDivisor.OrderSystem` API.  What is new here is the
order system of the places of a function field, and the function-field statements that need
the places themselves.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Place.orderSystem`: the places of `F / k` with their order functions, as an
  `OrderSystem` on `Additive Fˣ`.  Its finiteness condition is Stichtenoth, Corollary 1.3.4.
* `TauCeti.Divisor.principal` and `TauCeti.Divisor.principalHom`: `div z` for `z : Fˣ`, and its
  packaging as a group homomorphism `Additive Fˣ →+ Divisor k F` (Definition 1.4.2).
* `TauCeti.Divisor.zeros` and `TauCeti.Divisor.poles`: the zero divisor `(z)₀ = (div z)⁺` and
  the pole divisor `(z)_∞ = (div z)⁻` (Definition 1.4.2).

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Divisor.zeros_sub_poles`: `div z = (z)₀ - (z)_∞`, with both parts effective.
* `TauCeti.Divisor.poles_eq_natCast_zsmul_ofPoint_of_ord_eq_neg`: a function with a single pole,
  of order `n` at `P`, has pole divisor `nP`.
* `TauCeti.Divisor.principal_eq_zero_iff_mem_algebraicClosure`: `div z = 0` exactly when `z` is
  a constant, and `TauCeti.Divisor.principal_eq_zero_iff`: over an exact constant field, exactly
  when `z ∈ kˣ`.
* `TauCeti.Divisor.exists_units_algebraMap_mul_of_principal_eq`: over an exact constant field,
  two functions with the same divisor differ by a constant, and
  `TauCeti.Divisor.exists_units_algebraMap_mul_of_principal_eq_of_isAlgClosed`: likewise over an
  algebraically closed one.
* `TauCeti.Divisor.linearlyEquivalent_iff`: two divisors are linearly equivalent exactly when
  their difference is the divisor of a function (Definition 1.4.3).
* `TauCeti.Divisor.mem_principalSubgroup_iff` and
  `TauCeti.Divisor.divisorClass_eq_zero_iff`: the principal-subgroup and trivial-class predicates
  in terms of the divisor of a function.

## Implementation notes

`div` is defined on `Fˣ`, not on `F` with a nonzero hypothesis, so its multiplicativity is packaged
as the group homomorphism `Additive Fˣ →+ Divisor k F`.  For a nonzero `f : F` the divisor is
`div (Units.mk0 f hf)`, and `TauCeti.Divisor.coeff_principal` reads its coefficients back as orders
of the underlying function.

The function-field hypothesis `IsFunctionField k F` is an explicit argument rather than a
typeclass, following the rest of this directory; it is what makes the support finite, so it
cannot be avoided in the definition.  Since it is a `Prop`, two spellings of it give the same
divisor.

The degree of a principal divisor is **not** computed here: `deg (div z) = 0` is the product
formula (Stichtenoth, Theorem 1.4.11), which needs `deg (z)₀ = [F : k(z)]` and is separate work.
Everything in this file is independent of it.

## Provenance

`exists_units_algebraMap_mul_of_principal_eq` corresponds to `const_of_projectiveDivisorOf_eq_zero`
in AINTLIB's `HasseWeil/HasseBound/WeilPairing/Constancy.lean`, which states it for plane curves.
