# Membership and order for `IntermediateField.extendRight`

For a tower `K ⊆ L ⊆ M`, `IntermediateField.extendRight F M` is the copy of an intermediate
field `F` of `L / K` inside `M`. Mathlib defines it and transfers algebra structure along it,
but records nothing about how it sits in the order on intermediate fields of `M / K`. This file
adds that, together with the universal property of the copy of a simple extension `K⟮g⟯`: it is
the smallest intermediate field of `M / K` containing the image of `g`.

## Main results

* `IntermediateField.extendRight_eq_map`: the copy, as an `IntermediateField.map`.
* `IntermediateField.extendRight_le_iff`: the copy of `F` lies below an intermediate
  field exactly when that field contains every image from `F`.
* `IntermediateField.extendRight_adjoin_simple_le_iff`: the copy of `K⟮g⟯` lies inside an
  intermediate field exactly when that field contains the image of `g`.

/-- `F.extendRight M` as an `IntermediateField.map`, spelled with `IsScalarTower.toAlgHom`. -/
-- Load-bearing rather than a cosmetic unfolding: `extendRight` is defined through
-- `Algebra.algHom`, while the `map` lemmas that meet it here are stated with
-- `IsScalarTower.toAlgHom`. The two are one term but not one piece of syntax, and
-- `relfinrank_map_map` will not unify across them.
theorem extendRight_eq_map (F : IntermediateField K L) :
    F.extendRight M = F.map (IsScalarTower.toAlgHom K L M) := rfl

/-- **The copy of `F` is below an intermediate field exactly when that field contains every
image from `F`.** This decides an inclusion pointwise, with no `comap`. -/
-- Not `@[simp]`: it and `extendRight_adjoin_simple_le_iff` below cannot both be, since this
-- rewrites that one's left-hand side and `simpNF` rejects the pair. The simple-extension form
-- is the one worth reaching automatically, so it keeps the attribute and this is used by name.
