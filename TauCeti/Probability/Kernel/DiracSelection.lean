# Selecting the point of an almost surely Dirac kernel

A kernel into a nonempty, countably generated measurable space that is Dirac almost
everywhere for a given source measure agrees almost everywhere with a Dirac kernel
induced by a measurable map. This is the measure-relative version of Mathlib's
`ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.IsDeterministic.exists_eq_deterministic`, which assumes a
deterministic kernel at every source point.
