# Coordinate marginals of an invariant random path measure

A random probability measure `P` on path space need not be exchangeable almost surely even when
its law is invariant under coordinate permutations.  The distinction is essential for separately
exchangeable arrays: their row-directing measure transforms equivariantly under column
permutations, while its distribution is invariant.

This file extracts the first exchangeable sequence carried by such a random measure.  The path
`coordinateMarginals P` records the one-coordinate pushforwards

```text
j ↦ P.map (x ↦ x j).
```

It is equivariant under reindexing of `P`.  Consequently, if a law `π` on random path measures is
invariant under pushforward by every coordinate permutation, then `coordinateMarginals`, viewed as
a process on the probability space `π`, is exchangeable.  De Finetti therefore resolves these
random marginals, after applying a measurable injective code, into a directing law and, in the
probability case, into a measurable function of one global parameter and independent uniform
variables indexed by the coordinates. The code is necessary because Mathlib does not equip the
Giry measurable space on `ProbabilityMeasure α` with a standard-Borel instance.

The coordinate marginals do not in general determine `P`; this API records only its
one-coordinate pushforwards, not its higher finite-dimensional marginals.

## Main definitions and results

* `TauCeti.Probability.map_map_permReindex_eq_of_map_eq` -- invariance in law under reindexing
  implies invariance under the induced action on random path measures;
* `TauCeti.Probability.coordinateMarginals` -- the path of one-coordinate marginals of a
  path law;
* `TauCeti.Probability.coordinateMarginals_map_permReindex` -- equivariance under coordinate
  permutations;
* `TauCeti.Probability.exchangeable_coordinateMarginals_of_invariant` -- an invariant law of
  random path measures gives an exchangeable measure-valued sequence;
* `TauCeti.Probability.codedCoordinateMarginals` -- the same marginals in a standard Borel
  code;
* `TauCeti.Probability.conditionallyIID_codedCoordinateMarginals_of_invariant` -- the
  corresponding conditional de Finetti factorization;
* `TauCeti.Probability.exists_pathLaw_codedCoordinateMarginals_eq_map_unitIntervalCoding` -- the
  functional representation by a global parameter and independent coordinate noise.
