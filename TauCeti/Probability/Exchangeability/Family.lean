# Exchangeable families

This file extends the sequence-level symmetry predicates to families indexed by an arbitrary type.
An `ExchangeableFamily` has the same law along any two finite injective selections of indices.
The existing `MixedIIDWith` and `MixedIID` predicates are already index-generic; this file relates
them to exchangeable families.

## Main results

* `exchangeableFamily_iff_exchangeable` identifies the family predicate over `ℕ` with the existing
  sequence predicate.
* `MixedIIDWith.exchangeableFamily` and `MixedIID.exchangeableFamily` give the easy implication
  from the mixture identity to exchangeability: along any two injective selections the block law is
  the same mixture of product measures.
* `ExchangeableFamily.comp_injective` reindexes a family along an injection; the corresponding
  conditional i.i.d. lemmas are in `ConditionallyIID.Basic`.
* `ExchangeableFamily.congr` transports the predicate across a coordinatewise a.e. change of
  family, matching the sequence-level congruences in `Exchangeability/Congr.lean`.

The de Finetti theorem for countably infinite index types is in
`TauCeti.Probability.DeFinetti.CountableIndex`.

whole laws on `κ → α`. This is the family-level counterpart of
`Exchangeable.fullyExchangeable`, which is the case `κ = ι = ℕ` with `e` a permutation and
`f = id`. -/
