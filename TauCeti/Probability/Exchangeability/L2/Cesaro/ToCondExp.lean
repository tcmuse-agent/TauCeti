# The Cesàro limit of an observable is its conditional expectation given the process tail

Layer 3 of the Exchangeability roadmap produces the Cesàro limit of an observable of a contractable
process twice over: `weighted_sums_converge_L1_of_memLp` gives it as an abstract `L¹` limit, and
`Contractable.exists_tailProcess_measurable_cesaro_limit_of_memLp` places it on the process tail
`tailProcess X`. Neither says *what* the limit is.

This file identifies it:

* `Contractable.condExp_blockAverage_tailProcess_ae_eq` — every block average of `f ∘ X` has the
  same conditional expectation given `tailProcess X` as the single coordinate `f ∘ X 0`;
* `Contractable.tendsto_integral_abs_blockAverage_sub_condExp_of_memLp` — the block averages
  converge in `L¹` to `μ[f ∘ X 0 | tailProcess X]` along *every* eventually injective moving
  selection, fixed starts (`fixedStart`) and disjoint windows (`disjointWindow`) alike, with
  `Contractable.tendsto_integral_abs_blockAverage_sub_condExp` the bounded-observable form;
* `Contractable.ae_eq_condExp_tailProcess_of_tendsto_integral_abs` — consequently *any* `L¹` limit
  of those block averages, along any eventually injective selection, is a.e. that conditional
  expectation.

Both ingredients are already in place, and the argument is short. Contractability makes all
coordinates share a conditional law given the tail (`Contractable.condExp_comp_tailProcess_ae_eq`),
so the conditional expectation of every window is `μ[f ∘ X 0 | tailProcess X]`; the limit is
tail-measurable, hence its own conditional expectation; and conditional expectation is
`L¹`-continuous (`TauCeti.MeasureTheory.condExp_ae_eq_of_forall_condExp_ae_eq_of_tendsto_eLpNorm`).
No reverse-martingale convergence theorem is used, which is what keeps this on the `L²` route
rather than the martingale one.

The roadmap maps `Exchangeability/Bridge/CesaroToCondExp.lean` in `cameronfreer/exchangeability`
(pin `e0532e59ceff23edab44dda9ab0655debbc9cc22`) as the Layer 3 source for this bridge. No material
is ported from it: the identification here is assembled from Tau Ceti's own tail-measurability
result and its `L¹`-continuity lemma, and it conditions on the *process* tail `tailProcess X`
throughout.

/-- **Block averages do not move the conditional expectation given the tail.** For a contractable
process all coordinates share a conditional law given `tailProcess X`, so the conditional
expectation of the average of any nonempty finite block of `f ∘ X` is the conditional expectation of
a single coordinate. -/

/-- **The block averages converge to a conditional expectation.** For a measurable observable `f`
whose composite with a single coordinate is square-integrable, the block averages of `f ∘ X` along
a contractable process converge in `L¹` to `μ[f ∘ X 0 | tailProcess X]`, for every selection `k`
that is injective for all sufficiently large lengths — the selection may move with the length.

This is the identification the Layer 3 route needs: the limit supplied by
`weighted_sums_converge_L1_of_memLp` is not merely tail-measurable, it is the conditional
expectation of a single coordinate given the tail. -/
