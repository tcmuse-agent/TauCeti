# The Cesàro limit of an observable of a contractable process is tail-measurable

Layer 3 of the Exchangeability roadmap reaches `weighted_sums_converge_L1_of_memLp`: the block
averages of a square-integrable observable of a contractable process converge in `L¹` to a common
limit, along every eventually-injective selection — fixed-start windows and disjoint windows
alike. That limit is produced as an abstract `L¹` limit, so nothing about
*where it lives* comes for free.

`Contractable.exists_tailProcess_measurable_cesaro_limit_of_memLp` shows the limit has a
`tailProcess X`-measurable representative, with `…_cesaro_limit` the bounded-observable corollary.

This file's responsibility is **measurability of the limit**, deliberately separate from
identifying *what* the limit is: `Exchangeability.L2.Cesaro.ToCondExp` identifies it with
`μ[f ∘ X 0 | tailProcess X]`. Keeping the two apart is what lets the measurability argument avoid
the reverse-martingale theorem entirely.

The argument does not use the reverse-martingale convergence theorem `tendsto_ae_condExp_iInf` of
Layer 4, which is what distinguishes this route from the martingale one. The window starting at `r`
is `tailFamily X r`-measurable; `L¹` convergence gives an a.e.-convergent subsequence, so the limit
is `AEStronglyMeasurable[tailFamily X r]` for **every** `r`, and `tailProcess X` is exactly the
infimum of that antitone family.

The roadmap maps `Exchangeability/Bridge/CesaroToCondExp.lean` in `cameronfreer/exchangeability`
(pin `e0532e59ceff23edab44dda9ab0655debbc9cc22`) as a Layer 3 source. This file is **not**
adapted from it: the
tail-measurability step is assembled from Tau Ceti's existing general helpers
`aestronglyMeasurable_of_tendsto_ae'` and `aestronglyMeasurable_iInf_of_antitone` (themselves
adapted from that repository's `Probability/SigmaAlgebraHelpers.lean`, and carrying attribution
there), rather than by porting a bridge file. The divergence is deliberate: separating tail
measurability from the conditional-expectation identification keeps this prerequisite independent
of the directing measure.

/-- **A block average over tail indices is tail-measurable.** If every index of the family `k` is at
least `r`, each coordinate `f ∘ X (k j)` is `tailFamily X r`-measurable, hence so is their average.
Only measurability of `f` is needed: no measure, and no contractability of `X`.

The indices need not be consecutive — `blockAverage` averages over an arbitrary `k : Fin n → ℕ`,
and only `r ≤ k j` is used. -/

/-- **The Cesàro limit lives on the tail.** For a measurable observable `f` whose composite with a
single coordinate is square-integrable, the common `L¹` limit of the moving injective block
averages supplied by `weighted_sums_converge_L1_of_memLp` has a **`tailProcess X`-measurable**
representative.

The limit is the same function for every selection, so the conclusion carries the general form
through; fixed starts are only used *inside* the proof, where placing the limit on `tailFamily X r`
needs a window that begins at `r`. -/
