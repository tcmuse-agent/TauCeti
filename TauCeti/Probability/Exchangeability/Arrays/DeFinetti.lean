# De Finetti's theorem for exchangeable arrays

The consequences of de Finetti's theorem for the array symmetries: over a nonempty standard Borel
state space, the rows and columns of a separately exchangeable array are conditionally i.i.d., as
are the rows of a block of a jointly exchangeable one, and the directing measures produced this way
inherit the symmetry of the array.

**This is the array subtree's only direct import of the de Finetti summit.** `Arrays.Coding`
reaches `DeFinetti.Theorem` too, transitively through this module, which is as it should be: the
coding representation is a de Finetti consequence. What changed is that the dependency now arrives
through the one file whose subject it is.

`Arrays.Basic` carries the symmetry predicates and their elementary theory, `Arrays.Block.Basic` the
combinatorics of blocks, and `Arrays.MixingLaw` the results that hold of *any* supplied mixing
representative. Each of those is now independent of `DeFinetti.Theorem`, so a file needing only
array symmetry — for instance `Arrays.AldousHoover.Basic`, which uses four declarations from
`Arrays.Basic` — no longer depends on the representation theory at all.

The layering is therefore

```text
array symmetry  →  consequences of a supplied mixture  →  de Finetti supplies one  →  coding
```

## Main results

* `SeparatelyExchangeable.conditionallyIID_arrayRow` and `…_arrayCol` — de Finetti for the rows and
  columns;
* `JointlyExchangeable.conditionallyIID_arrayRow_arrayBlock` and `…_arrayBlockPair` — de Finetti
  for the rows of a block;
* `SeparatelyExchangeable.exists_directing_arrayRow_mixingLaw_invariant` and `…_arrayCol…` — a
  directing measure whose law inherits the array's symmetry.

/-- **De Finetti's theorem for the rows of a separately exchangeable array.** Over a nonempty
standard Borel state space `α`, the rows of a separately exchangeable array are conditionally
i.i.d. as random elements of path space `ℕ → α`.

This is the first step of the standard route to the Aldous–Hoover representation. Path space is
standard Borel because `α` is (`StandardBorelSpace.pi_countable`), so the hypotheses are exactly
de Finetti's. -/
