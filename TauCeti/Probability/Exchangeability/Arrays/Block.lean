# Rectangular blocks of an exchangeable array

Joint exchangeability alone guarantees only invariance under the diagonal reindexing
`(i, j) ↦ (σ i, σ j)`, so the rows of a jointly exchangeable array need not be exchangeable and the
separately exchangeable theory does not apply to it in general. This file supplies the standard
device that repairs this: read the array on a **rectangular block** `arrayBlock X e f`, whose
`(i, j)`-entry is `X (e i, f j)`, along two injections `e, f : ℕ → ℕ` **with disjoint ranges**. On
such a block the single permutation the array is invariant under has two independent halves — one
permutation may be prescribed on the range of `e` and another, unrelated one on the range of `f`,
because a permutation of `ℕ` is free to act differently on two disjoint sets — and the block is
therefore *separately* exchangeable
(`JointlyExchangeable.separatelyExchangeable_arrayBlock`). Every theorem about separately
exchangeable arrays is then available for it; in particular de Finetti's theorem makes the rows of
the block conditionally i.i.d.

The block only sees the entries `X (e i, f j)`, so it omits the reverse-orientation entries
`X (f j, e i)`. Reading the two together as an array of pairs retains both orientations of the
selected rectangular cross-block, and the pair array is separately exchangeable
(`JointlyExchangeable.separatelyExchangeable_arrayBlockPair`). For a *symmetric* array the two
coordinates of each such pair agree.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Probability.arrayBlock` — the rectangular block of an array along two index maps;
* `TauCeti.Probability.arrayBlockPair` — the same block, read together with its transpose.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.arrayBlock` — separate exchangeability passes to
  every block along injections, no disjointness needed;
* `TauCeti.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.map_arrayBlock_eq` — such a block even has the law
  of the array itself;
* `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyExchangeable.arrayBlock_diag` — joint exchangeability passes to the
  diagonal blocks `arrayBlock X e e`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyExchangeable.separatelyExchangeable_arrayBlock` — **the block
  theorem**: a block of a jointly exchangeable array along injections with disjoint ranges is
  separately exchangeable;
* `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyExchangeable.separatelyExchangeable_arrayBlockPair` — the same for
  the block read together with its transpose;
* `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyExchangeable.separatelyExchangeable_arrayBlock_evenOdd` — the
  canonical instance, along the even and the odd indices;
* `TauCeti.Probability.not_separatelyExchangeable_arrayBlock_diagIndicatorArray` — the disjointness
  hypothesis is necessary;
* `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyExchangeable.map_arrayBlock_eq` — the block law does not depend on
  the chosen pair of index maps;
* `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyExchangeable.map_arrayBlockPair_eq` — the corresponding canonical-law
  theorem for the pair-valued block;

/-- The common argument behind the two canonical-law theorems below, stated for an arbitrary
read-off `B u v` of the array's sample path along the index maps `u` and `v`. Besides being
measurable, `B` has to commute with a permutation of both axes (`hBperm`) and to read the entry at
`p` through the index maps only at `p.1` and `p.2` (`hBapply`); the block and the block of pairs
both satisfy these by `rfl` and by congruence.

The two laws are compared one finite-dimensional marginal at a time, because a single permutation
matches the two pairs of index maps only below a finite bound (`exists_perm_apply_eq_of_lt`). -/
