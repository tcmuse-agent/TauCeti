# Coupled row coding for separately exchangeable arrays

The first functional representation of a separately exchangeable array writes each row as a
sample from one random path law, using independent uniform noise for the rows.  For the second
level of the Aldous--Hoover argument, it is essential to retain that random path law as a
coordinate: column permutations act on it by pushforward, rather than leaving it fixed.

This file packages the resulting canonical joint law.  If `π` is a law on probability measures on
path space, `arrayRowCodingLaw π` is the law of

```text
(P, (i, j) ↦ unitIntervalCoding (ℕ → α) P (Uᵢ) j),
```

where `P` has law `π` and the `Uᵢ` are independent uniform variables.  A directing measure for
the row process of an array identifies its joint law with this canonical law.  For a separately
exchangeable array, the canonical law retains the full two-axis symmetry: row permutations act
on the coded array alone, while column permutations act simultaneously on the array and by
pushforward on `P`.

This file stops short of the final Aldous--Hoover representation, which further resolves the
random path law into column and cell noise.

## Main definitions and results

* `TauCeti.Probability.arrayRowCodingLaw` -- the canonical joint law of the random row law and the
  coded array;
* `TauCeti.Probability.rowCodingArrayLaw` -- its array marginal;
* `TauCeti.Probability.ConditionallyIIDWith.jointLaw_arrayRow_eq_arrayRowCodingLaw` -- a row
  directing measure identifies the original coupled law with the canonical coding law;
* `TauCeti.Probability.SeparatelyExchangeable.map_pairReindex_arrayRowCodingLaw_eq` -- the coupled
  coding law inherits the two-axis equivariance of the directing measure and the array.
* `TauCeti.Probability.map_pairReindex_arrayRowCodingLaw_eq_of_col_invariant` -- the canonical
  coupled law has the same equivariance whenever its mixing law is invariant.
