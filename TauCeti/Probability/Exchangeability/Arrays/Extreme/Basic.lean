# Extreme jointly exchangeable array laws and finitary tests

A jointly exchangeable probability law on array path space `ℕ × ℕ → α` is an extreme point of
the convex set of jointly exchangeable probability laws if and only if its coordinate array is
jointly dissociated. With the corner-tail theorem and the ergodicity theorem this completes the
representation-free triangle for jointly exchangeable arrays: joint dissociation, triviality of
the corner tail, ergodicity of the diagonal finitary relabelling action, and extremality are one
condition, stated on the law alone for any measurable value space.

The jointly exchangeable probability laws are exactly the probability laws invariant under the
diagonal action of the finitely supported permutations: invariance under the finitary
permutations already gives invariance under every permutation, since a law is determined by its
finite-dimensional marginals and on finitely many indices any permutation agrees with a finitely
supported one. The extreme-point characterisation is then the general one for a countable group
action, `ErgodicSMul.iff_mem_extremePoints`, composed with `jointlyDissociated_iff_ergodicSMul`.
The same finite-dimensional approximation also shows that separate exchangeability can be tested
using pairs of finitely supported axis permutations.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.jointlyExchangeable_of_smulInvariantMeasure` — invariance under the
  finitary diagonal action gives joint exchangeability;
* `TauCeti.Probability.separatelyExchangeable_iff_map_pairReindex_finitary` — separate
  exchangeability is invariance under pairs of finitely supported axis relabellings;
* `TauCeti.Probability.jointlyExchangeableProbabilityMeasures` — the convex set, and its
  identification with the invariant measures of total mass one of the diagonal action;
* `TauCeti.Probability.jointlyDissociated_iff_mem_extremePoints` — **joint dissociation is
  extremality** among jointly exchangeable probability laws, with
  `jointlyDissociated_of_mem_extremePoints` reading dissociation off an extreme point;
* `TauCeti.Probability.jointlyExchangeableProbabilityMeasuresOn` — the jointly exchangeable
  probability laws carried by a set of arrays, a face of the whole set, so that
  `jointlyDissociated_iff_mem_extremePoints_on` restricts the characterisation to them, and
  `jointlyExchangeableProbabilityMeasuresOnSymmetricArraysWithDiag` the case of the symmetric
  arrays with a fixed diagonal, the adjacency arrays of graphs when `α = Bool`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyDissociated.ae_eq_of_comp_eq` — the integral form: a jointly
  dissociated law written as a mixture of jointly exchangeable laws has almost every component
  equal to itself.
