# Global-free Aldous--Hoover codings are dissociated

Coding through a function that ignores its global variable gives the **ergodic form** of the
Aldous--Hoover representation, and the arrays it produces are dissociated as well as exchangeable:
two blocks over disjoint row sets and disjoint column sets read disjoint sets of noise coordinates
once the global one is out of the way, and the noise coordinates are independent.  This is the
easy direction of the ergodic form of the theorem.  The shared global coordinate obstructs this
disjoint-noise proof, and a nontrivial array built from global noise alone is not dissociated, by
`JointlyDissociated.measure_preimage_eq_zero_or_one_of_const`.

Conversely, the global variable of any coding of a dissociated law can be dropped: freezing it at
almost any value leaves the law unchanged.  Freezing the global argument of a coding `f` at `t`
leaves the *frozen coding* `(a, b, c) ↦ f (t, a, b, c)`, which reads no global noise.  Since the
global noise coordinate is uniform and independent of the coordinates the frozen codings read, the
law of `f` is the mixture of the laws of its frozen codings over a uniform `t`
(`map_jointArray_eq_bind_frozen`, `map_separateArray_eq_bind_frozen`).  Read from right to left
this identity also assembles one coding out of a measurable family of global-free ones.  Each
frozen coding is jointly exchangeable, and a jointly dissociated law is not a nontrivial mixture of
jointly exchangeable laws (`JointlyDissociated.ae_eq_of_comp_eq`), so almost every frozen coding
has the original law.  Hence the ergodic form of the representation follows from the general one,
for both array symmetries; and since the frozen codings of a separate coding are separately
exchangeable, hence jointly exchangeable, the separate statement too needs only joint dissociation
of the law.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.AldousHoover.separatelyDissociated_separateArray_of_snd`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.AldousHoover.jointlyDissociated_jointArray_of_snd`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.AldousHoover.map_jointArray_eq_bind_frozen` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.AldousHoover.map_separateArray_eq_bind_frozen`: the law of a coding is the
  uniform mixture of the laws of its frozen codings;
* `TauCeti.Probability.AldousHoover.ae_map_jointArray_eq_of_jointlyDissociated` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.AldousHoover.exists_map_jointArray_snd_eq_of_jointlyDissociated`: a jointly
  dissociated law with a joint coding also has one that ignores its global variable;
* `TauCeti.Probability.AldousHoover.ae_map_separateArray_eq_of_jointlyDissociated` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.AldousHoover.exists_map_separateArray_snd_eq_of_jointlyDissociated`: the
  same for a separate coding.
