# Dissociated arrays

The Aldous--Hoover representation of an exchangeable array has an **ergodic form**, in which the
array is a fixed measurable function of one variable per row, one per column, and one per cell,
with no global variable; the general form is a mixture of these over the global variable. The class
of laws the ergodic form describes is singled out by *dissociation*: sub-arrays over disjoint sets
of rows **and** disjoint sets of columns are independent.

Two disjointness conditions are needed, one per axis, and this file therefore carries the two
notions the two array symmetries ask for:

* `SeparatelyDissociated μ X` — the blocks `X (i, j)`, `i ∈ A`, `j ∈ B`, and `X (i, j)`, `i ∈ A'`,
  `j ∈ B'`, are independent whenever `A ∩ A' = ∅` and `B ∩ B' = ∅`. This is the notion paired with
  `SeparatelyExchangeable`;
* `JointlyDissociated μ X` — the square blocks over `A × A` and `A' × A'` are independent whenever
  `A ∩ A' = ∅`. This is the notion paired with `JointlyExchangeable`, and it is genuinely weaker
  (`SeparatelyDissociated.jointlyDissociated`): a symmetric array is not separately dissociated
  unless its off-diagonal entries are trivial, since `X (i, j)` and `X (j, i)` are then equal while
  separate dissociation asks them to be independent; it may perfectly well be jointly dissociated.

Index sets are presented, as in `Arrays/Block/Basic.lean`, by index maps `e f : ℕ → ℕ`.
The two sub-arrays are the rectangular blocks `arrayBlock X e f` and `arrayBlock X e' f'` and the
disjointness conditions read `Disjoint (Set.range e) (Set.range e')` and
`Disjoint (Set.range f) (Set.range f')`. Ranges of maps `ℕ → ℕ` are exactly the nonempty sets of
indices, and a block over an empty set of indices carries no information, so nothing is lost.

The same disjoint-block device that turns joint exchangeability into separate exchangeability also
transfers dissociation. If `e` and `f` are injections with disjoint ranges, every rectangular block
of `arrayBlock X e f` reads a square block of `X` on the union of its selected row and column
indices. Thus joint dissociation of `X` makes this block separately dissociated
(`JointlyDissociated.separatelyDissociated_arrayBlock`), including the pair-valued version that
retains both orientations. This is the bridge from the ergodic jointly exchangeable branch to the
separate Aldous--Hoover branch.

Dissociation is a restriction on the array and not a consequence of any exchangeability: an array
all of whose entries are one common random variable is separately exchangeable, but dissociating it
forces that variable to be almost surely trivial
(`JointlyDissociated.measure_preimage_eq_zero_or_one_of_const`). Thus nontrivial randomness shared
unchanged by every entry is incompatible with dissociation; the ergodic Aldous--Hoover coding drops
the global noise coordinate entirely.

These results advance the exchangeable-arrays milestone of
`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, Layer 8. The dissociated codings themselves are in
`Arrays/AldousHoover/Dissociated.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Probability.SeparatelyDissociated`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyDissociated`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.SeparatelyDissociated.jointlyDissociated` — the implication between the two
  notions;
* `TauCeti.Probability.separatelyDissociated_of_iIndepFun` — an array of independent entries is
  separately dissociated;
* `TauCeti.Probability.SeparatelyDissociated.arrayBlock` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyDissociated.arrayBlock_diag` — dissociation passes to blocks along
  injective index maps;
* `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyDissociated.separatelyDissociated_arrayBlock` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyDissociated.separatelyDissociated_arrayBlockPair` — a block along two
  injections with disjoint ranges converts joint dissociation to separate dissociation;
* `TauCeti.Probability.SeparatelyDissociated.map_values` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyDissociated.map_values` — dissociation is preserved by a measurable
  coordinatewise pushforward;
* `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyDissociated.indep_blockSigma_prod_self` — square blocks over
  arbitrary disjoint index sets generate independent σ-algebras;
* `TauCeti.Probability.jointlyDissociated_iff_indep_blockSigma_finset` — conversely, independence
  of the square blocks over disjoint finite index sets already gives joint dissociation;
* `TauCeti.Probability.SeparatelyDissociated.indepFun_apply` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyDissociated.indepFun_arrayDiag` — entries in different rows and
  different columns are independent, so in particular the diagonal entries of a jointly dissociated
  array are pairwise independent;
* `TauCeti.Probability.JointlyDissociated.measure_preimage_eq_zero_or_one_of_const` — a dissociated
  array with all entries equal has an almost surely trivial entry;
* `TauCeti.Probability.SeparatelyDissociated.measure_preimage_eq_zero_or_one_of_symm` — a symmetric
  array is separately dissociated only if it is trivial off the diagonal, which is the sharp form
  of the separation between the two notions.
