# Extreme exchangeable laws

The extreme points of the convex set of exchangeable probability measures on `ℕ → α` are exactly
the i.i.d. product laws. The main theorem `exchangeable_extreme_iff_iid` states this using Mathlib's
`Set.extremePoints` for the natural `ℝ≥0∞`-module structure on measures.

The exchangeable probability laws are the probability laws invariant under the action of the
finitely supported permutations of `ℕ` (`exchangeableLaw_iff_smulInvariantMeasure`). Extremality
among them is therefore ergodicity of that action, by the general characterisation
`ErgodicSMul.iff_mem_extremePoints` for a countable group; ergodicity is triviality of the
exchangeable σ-algebra (`exchangeableSigma_trivial_iff_ergodicSMul`); and, for a standard Borel
state space, triviality is the i.i.d. property (`exchangeableSigma_trivial_iff_iid`). The
implication from i.i.d. to extreme needs no standard Borel hypothesis.

The one-sided shift ergodicity of an i.i.d. law, `ergodic_shift_infinitePi_const`, is recorded
here as well: shift-invariant events are exchangeable events, so the Hewitt–Savage zero-one law
applies.

## Main results

* `exchangeableProbabilityMeasures`, with its membership and convexity lemmas, and
  `exchangeableProbabilityMeasures_eq` — the exchangeable probability laws are the invariant
  probability laws of the finitary action.
* `ergodic_shift_infinitePi_const` — an i.i.d. product law is ergodic for the one-sided shift.
* `infinitePi_mem_extremePoints_exchangeable` — an i.i.d. product law is an extreme exchangeable
  law, over an arbitrary measurable space.
* `exchangeable_extreme_iff_iid` — the extreme exchangeable probability laws are exactly the
  i.i.d. product laws.
