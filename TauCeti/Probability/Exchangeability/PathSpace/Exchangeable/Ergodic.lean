# Exchangeable laws and ergodicity of the finitely supported permutation action

An exchangeable path law is invariant under the group of finitely supported permutations of the
time index.  This file records the resulting **group action** on path space and identifies
ergodicity of that action with triviality of the exchangeable σ-algebra:

```text
(∀ s, MeasurableSet[exchangeableSigma α] s → ρ s = 0 ∨ ρ s = 1)
  ↔  ErgodicSMul FinitaryPerm (ℕ → α) ρ
```

(`exchangeableSigma_trivial_iff_ergodicSMul`).

The two sides are not the same statement.  `exchangeableSigma` collects the events that are
**exactly** fixed by every finitely supported reindexing, while Mathlib's `ErgodicSMul` quantifies
over the **almost** invariant events.  The bridge is the countability of the acting group: an
almost invariant event agrees almost everywhere with an exchangeable one
(`exists_measurableSet_exchangeableSigma_ae_eq`), by the saturation argument of
`TauCeti.MeasureTheory.exists_smul_invariant_ae_eq`.

⚠ The permutation action here is the one on the *time index*, and ergodicity for it is a different
statement from ergodicity of the one-sided shift, which concerns the smaller σ-algebra of
shift-invariant events.  For an i.i.d. product law both hold: `ergodic_shift_infinitePi_const` is
the shift form and `ergodicSMul_infinitePi_const` below is the permutation form.

## Main declarations

* `instSMulFinitaryPermPath` — the path action of the finitary symmetric group
  `TauCeti.FinitaryPerm` (defined in `Algebra/GroupAction/FiniteSupportPerm.lean`) on `ℕ → α`
  by finitary reindexing of the time index, `(g • x) n = x (g⁻¹ n)`;
* `ExchangeableLaw.smulInvariantMeasure` — an exchangeable path law is invariant under it.

## Main results

* `exchangeableLaw_iff_smulInvariantMeasure` — a finite law is exchangeable exactly when it is
  invariant under the finitely supported permutation action.
* `exists_measurableSet_exchangeableSigma_ae_eq` — an almost invariant event agrees almost
  everywhere with an `exchangeableSigma`-measurable one.
* `exchangeableSigma_trivial_iff_ergodicSMul` — the zero-one law for `exchangeableSigma` is
  ergodicity of the finitely supported permutation action.
* `ergodicSMul_infinitePi_const` — Hewitt–Savage in ergodic form: the finitely supported
  permutations act ergodically on an i.i.d. product law.

This discharges the `ErgodicSMul` interface, item (1) ⇔ (2) of the zero-one/ergodic/extreme
interfaces of Layer 6 of the `Exchangeability` roadmap.  No material is adapted from
`cameronfreer/exchangeability`.

/-- **An almost invariant path event agrees almost everywhere with an exchangeable event.**

The exchangeable σ-algebra is defined by *exact* invariance under finitely supported reindexings,
while a.e. invariance is what Mathlib's ergodicity predicate supplies.  Because the group of
finitely supported permutations of `ℕ` is countable, the two agree modulo null sets: the
saturation of `s` under the whole group is an exchangeable event almost equal to `s`. -/

are handled through `exists_measurableSet_exchangeableSigma_ae_eq`, which is where countability of
the acting group is used. -/

/-- **The zero-one law for `exchangeableSigma` is ergodicity of the finitely supported permutation
action.**

Both sides say that an exchangeable path law admits no nontrivial permutation-invariant event; the
content of the equivalence is that it does not matter whether "invariant" is read exactly, as in
the σ-algebra `exchangeableSigma α`, or almost everywhere, as in Mathlib's `ErgodicSMul`.

⚠ The action is by finitely supported permutations of the time index.  This is *not* one-sided
shift ergodicity: the shift-invariant events form a smaller σ-algebra, so the two statements are
not interchangeable. -/

/-- **Hewitt–Savage in ergodic form.**  The finitely supported permutations of the time index act
ergodically on an i.i.d. product law `P^{⊗ℕ}`.

This is the zero-one law `exchangeableSigma_trivial_of_infinitePi` read through
`exchangeableSigma_trivial_iff_ergodicSMul`.  It is the permutation-action counterpart of the
shift ergodicity recorded by `ergodic_shift_infinitePi_const`. -/
