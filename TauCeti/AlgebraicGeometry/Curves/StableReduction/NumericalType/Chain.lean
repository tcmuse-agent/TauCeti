# Chains of `(-2)`-indices of arbitrary length

A `(-2)`-index of a numerical type is a component `i` with `gᵢ = 0` and `aᵢᵢ = -2wᵢ`. The
configurations that a set of `(-2)`-indices can form inside a numerical type with strictly more
components are of Dynkin-diagram shape, and
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/Curves/StableReduction/NumericalType/ProperSubgraph.lean` classifies
those on at most six components. This file treats the one infinite family, a chain
`i₁ - i₂ - ⋯ - i_t` of any length, packaged as
`TauCeti.NumericalType.IsSelfIntersectionMinusTwoChain`.

The underlying adjacency graph of such a chain in a numerical type with more components is a
path: no two of its components meet except along the chain, so in particular the chain never
closes up into a cycle.
From five components on, it also has at most one nonsimple edge, and that edge is at an end: all
its weights are equal except possibly at one end, where the weight may be the double or the half
of the common weight, and every edge has intersection number the larger of the weights of its two
endpoints by `TauCeti.NumericalType.intersection_eq_max_weight`. This is
[Stacks, Lemma 55.5.8](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C89), whose source statement is
restricted to more than five components because the five-component case is its Lemma 55.5.5.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.NumericalType.IsSelfIntersectionMinusTwoChain`: the predicate recording a chain of
  components of self-intersection `-2w`.
* `TauCeti.NumericalType.IsSelfIntersectionMinusTwoChain.intersection_eq_zero`: two components of
  such a chain which are not consecutive do not meet, provided the numerical type has more
  components than the chain has length.
* `TauCeti.NumericalType.IsSelfIntersectionMinusTwoChain.exists_weight_eq_except_one_end`: the
  weights along such a chain of at least five components are constant except possibly at one
  end.

/-- `T.IsSelfIntersectionMinusTwoChain t c` says that `c 0, …, c (t - 1)` are `t` distinct
components of the numerical type `T`, each of self-intersection `aᵢᵢ = -2wᵢ`, in which
consecutive components meet.
Positions are indexed by `ℕ`, with only the values below `t` constrained, so that a block of
consecutive positions is again a chain for the shifted index function.

This is weaker than asking each `c i` to be a `TauCeti.NumericalType.IsMinusTwoIndex`, which
also requires `gᵢ = 0`: the genus plays no role in the classification of the configurations that
`(-2)`-indices form, exactly as in the fixed-length classifications of

/-- The weights along a chain of components of self-intersection `-2w` in a numerical type with
more components than the chain has length are constant except possibly at one end, where the
weight may be twice or half the common interior weight. Together with
`TauCeti.NumericalType.IsSelfIntersectionMinusTwoChain.intersection_eq_zero` and
`TauCeti.NumericalType.intersection_eq_max_weight`, which turn these weights into the
intersection numbers, this is
