# Connected proper sets of `(-2)`-indices

Let `S` be a set of components of a numerical type, each of self-intersection `aᵢᵢ = -2wᵢ`, which
is connected, in the sense that no nonempty proper subset of `S` is disjoint from the rest of
`S`, and which is a proper subset of the components. This file proves that the configuration
formed by `S` has Dynkin-diagram shape
([Stacks, Proposition 55.5.17](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C8Q)): one of the following
holds.

* `S` is the set of components of a chain `c 0 - c 1 - ⋯ - c (t - 1)`
  (`TauCeti.NumericalType.IsSelfIntersectionMinusTwoChain`), the types `A`, `B`, `C`, `F₄` and
  `G₂`.
* `S` is the set of components of a fork, a chain of at least three components together with a
  leaf meeting its penultimate component (`TauCeti.NumericalType.IsSelfIntersectionMinusTwoFork`),
  the type `D`.
* `S` consists of a chain of five, six or seven components together with a leaf meeting the
  component `c (t - 3)` and no other component of the chain: the types `E₆`, `E₇` and `E₈`.

Since the exceptional sets have at most eight elements, a connected proper set of at least nine
such components is a chain or a fork. The
weights and intersection numbers of each shape are determined by the classifications already
available: `IsSelfIntersectionMinusTwoChain.exists_weight_eq_except_one_end` for chains,
`IsSelfIntersectionMinusTwoFork.exists_weight_intersection_eq` for forks, and
`exists_weight_intersection_branch_six_eq`, `exists_weight_intersection_branch_seven_eq` and
`IsSelfIntersectionMinusTwoChain.exists_weight_intersection_branch_eight_eq` for the exceptional
types. This is the input for the bound on the multiplicities of a minimal numerical type in
[Stacks, Lemma 55.7.3](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C9W), where a maximal connected set
of `(-2)`-indices is either small or a chain or a fork, the two shapes treated in
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/Curves/StableReduction/NumericalType/MultiplicityBound.lean`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.NumericalType.exists_chain_or_fork_or_exceptional`: the classification above.

-- The Stacks Project leaves the proof of Proposition 55.5.17 to the discussion at the start of
-- [Section 55.5](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C7L). The argument here starts from a
-- longest chain `c` inside `S`. A component of `S` outside the chain that meets it meets exactly
-- one of its components, an interior one: otherwise the chain could be lengthened or would close
-- up into a cycle, which `IsSelfIntersectionMinusTwoChain.intersection_eq_zero` excludes. Two
-- such components would form either a four-legged star (Stacks, Lemma 55.5.6) or a chain with
-- leaves at both ends (Stacks, Lemma 55.5.11), and such a component meeting a further component
-- of `S` would, by maximality of `c`, form an affine `E₆` diagram (Stacks, Lemma 55.5.12). So
-- `S` is the chain together with at most one leaf. A leaf at the second or penultimate component
-- gives a fork, and the affine `E₇` and `E₈` diagrams (Stacks, Lemmas 55.5.15 and 55.5.16)
-- confine every other position of the leaf to the exceptional types.
/-- **Classification of connected proper sets of `(-2)`-indices.** Let `S` be a proper subset of
the components of a numerical type, each of self-intersection `-2w`, which is connected: every
nonempty proper subset of `S` meets a component of `S` outside it. Then `S` is the set of
components of a chain, or of a fork, or of a chain of five, six or seven components together with
a leaf meeting `c (t - 3)` and no other component of the chain. These are the Dynkin diagrams of
types `A` (with `B`, `C`, `F₄` and `G₂`), `D` and `E₆`, `E₇`, `E₈`
