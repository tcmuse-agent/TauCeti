# Regularity and valuation rings at codimension-one points

At a codimension-one point of a scheme, the local ring has Krull dimension one. If it is
regular, it is a discrete valuation ring. This turns the regularity hypothesis on a curve
into the valuation-ring hypothesis used to define orders of vanishing and to compare Weil
and Cartier divisors.

The result combines `TauCeti.IsRegularLocalRing.isDiscreteValuationRing_iff_ringKrullDim_eq_one`
with Mathlib's `ringKrullDim_stalk_eq_coheight`.
