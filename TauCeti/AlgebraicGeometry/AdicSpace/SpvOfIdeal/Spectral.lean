# `Spv (A, I)` is a spectral space

**Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1), Lemma 7.5(1).**

Wedhorn gives `Spv (A, I)` the subspace topology of `Spv A` (§7.1, after (7.1.1)) and proves it
spectral with the sets

```text
Spv (A, I)(T/s) = { v ∈ Spv (A, I) | v(t) ≤ v(s) ≠ 0 for all t ∈ T },   I ⊆ √(T · A)
```

as a generating family. (Wedhorn states them as a basis of quasi-compact opens, and that is what
is proved: they generate the topology, which is what the patch criterion consumes; each is
quasi-compact; and the family is stable under intersection — Wedhorn's step (i) — which upgrades
generation to `isTopologicalBasis_rationalFamily`.)
No second topology on the subtype is introduced here: the
`Subtype` instance *is* that topology, which is the content of
`instTopologicalSpace_spvOfIdeal_eq_generateFrom`.

The proof is Wedhorn's, via the patch criterion `TauCeti.spectralSpace_of_isClopen_generateFrom`
(his Proposition 3.31). The compact witness topology it consumes is the one **coinduced along
the retraction** `r_I : Spv A → Spv (A, I)` from the patch topology of `Spv A`. That choice is
what makes the proof short: continuity of `r_I` holds by construction, and compactness is then
the image of the compact `(Spv A)_cons` under a surjection. Wedhorn's step (iii) is still
needed, but only as `restrictToIdealCodRestrict_preimage`, which turns clopen-ness of
`Spv(A)(T/s)` in the patch of `Spv A` into clopen-ness of `Spv(A,I)(T/s)` in the witness
topology.

Wedhorn's step (i) — stability of the family under intersection — is **not** needed for
spectrality: the subspace topology is `induced` of a `generateFrom`, so `induced_generateFrom_eq`
reduces the basis condition to single subbasic opens, and the patch criterion absorbs finite
intersections itself. It is needed for the *basis* claim, and later for the spectral-map half of
Lemma 7.5(2), so it is proved here all the same: `basicOpenFinset_inter` supplies the identity in
`Spv A`, `IsAdmissible.mul` keeps the product pair admissible, and `inter_mem_rationalFamily`
closes the family.

Note that `Spv (A, I)` is *not* pro-constructible in `Spv A` in general, so
`TauCeti.IsProConstructible.spectralSpace` cannot be used: that would give a spectral inclusion
(`TauCeti.IsProConstructible.isSpectralMap_subtypeVal`), which Wedhorn's Remark 7.6 denies.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.basicOpenFinset` : Wedhorn's `Spv(A)(T/s)` for finite `T`.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.IsAdmissible` : his condition `I ⊆ √(T · A)` on a numerator set.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.rationalFamily` : Wedhorn's family `R`, which generates the
  topology of `Spv (A, I)`.
(Two things used in the proof are deliberately private: the compact witness topology coinduced
along `r_I`, a device for the patch criterion rather than API, and the two branch lemmas of step
(ii), whose statements are specific to the case split. `exists_isAdmissible_basicOpenFinset`
below is the public neighbourhood interface that merges them.)

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spectralSpace_spvOfIdeal` : **Lemma 7.5(1)**.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.instTopologicalSpace_spvOfIdeal_eq_generateFrom` : **step (ii)**,
  that `R` generates the subspace topology.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.isTopologicalBasis_rationalFamily` : **step (i)**, that `R` is
  moreover a *basis* — it is closed under intersection, through `IsAdmissible.mul` and
  `inter_mem_rationalFamily`.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.restrictToIdealCodRestrict_preimage` : **step (iii)**,
  `r_I⁻¹(Spv(A,I)(T/s)) = Spv(A)(T/s)`.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.isCompact_of_mem_rationalFamily` : the members of `R` are
  quasi-compact, the other half of what Lemma 7.5(1) asserts about them.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.continuous_restrictToIdealCodRestrict` : **Lemma 7.5(2)**, the
  continuity half — steps (ii) and (iii) give it at once.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.isSpectralMap_restrictToIdealCodRestrict` : **Lemma 7.5(2)**, the
  spectral-map half, closing out Lemma 7.5: spectrality is tested on the basis `R`, whose
  preimages step (iii) computes and `isCompact_basicOpenFinset` bounds.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.isProConstructible_val_preimage_setOfPred_forall_vle_one` : the
  sub-unit locus of a set of ring elements is pro-constructible in `Spv (A, I)` — the form
  Wedhorn's Theorem 7.35 consumes, proved from the rational family since the inclusion into
  `Spv A` is not spectral.

## Provenance

The corresponding development in AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0), project
`projects/AdicSpaces/`, file `Adic spaces/SpvAITopology.lean`, was consulted rather than copied,
and this file departs from it in two ways. Two revisions are cited below, each for what was
checked against it: branch `dev/adic-spaces` at `37bbdaeb9ad9e3bc9f0d660feadc2779e455a91c`, the
revision the spectrality material here was written against, and
`2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08`, the revision re-checked when Lemma 7.5(2) was added.

First, AINTLIB equips `Spv (A, I)` with a *separate* topology, `SpvAI.topology`, described there
as strictly finer than the subspace topology. That reading of Remark 7.6 is not Wedhorn's:
Remark 7.6 says the inclusion is not a spectral *map*, whereas Wedhorn's step (ii) proves `R` to
be a basis of the subspace topology itself. AINTLIB proves only the trivial half,
`SpvAI.topology_le_induced`; the converse is `instTopologicalSpace_spvOfIdeal_eq_generateFrom`
here, and the two topologies therefore agree.

Second, AINTLIB's route to compactness and quasi-soberness goes through
`SpvAI.retraction_continuous`. At `2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08` that theorem carries
a proof, but it rests on `Spv.restrictIdeal_preimage_basicOpen_isOpen` — openness of
`r_I⁻¹(Spv(A)(f/s))` for an *arbitrary* pair `(f, s)` — which is a `sorry` there, as is
`SpvAI.retraction_preimage_rationalSubset`. Taking the witness topology coinduced along the
retraction removes the need for continuity in the proof of 7.5(1), and quasi-soberness then comes
from the patch criterion rather than from a transfer along the retraction. Continuity is proved
below all the same, as Lemma 7.5(2) in its own right, and by a route that needs only the
*admissible* preimages already computed for 7.5(1) — never the general-`(f, s)` statement.

The two branches of step (ii) below follow AINTLIB's `SpvAI.exists_rationalSubset_microbial` and
`SpvAI.exists_rationalSubset_cofinality`, which are proved there; they are restated against
`characteristicSubgroup … = ⊤` and `CofinalValue` rather than `IsMicrobial`, and the cofinal
branch takes one exponent per generator instead of a uniform one.

everything, so its radical is `⊤` and the containment defining admissibility is vacuous — for

branch of 7.5(ii), where Wedhorn's witness `Spv(A,I)((g₁d, …, gₙd, 1)/g₀d)` carries `1` among
its numerators; the cofinal branch instead needs

is the witness Wedhorn takes at the start of the `Γ_v = cΓ_v` branch of 7.5(ii): full
characteristic group means `(v s)⁻¹` is dominated by an attained value. -/

equally available here: cofinality already forces each generator's value below `1`
(`cofinalValueFor_top_iff` with `CofinalValueFor.lt_one`), so the largest of the individual
exponents would serve. Nothing downstream needs the exponents to agree, so they are chosen

/-- **Wedhorn, Lemma 7.5(1)**: `Spv (A, I)` is a spectral space.

The patch criterion is applied with the subspace topology as the generated one — the admissible
rational subsets generate it by `instTopologicalSpace_spvOfIdeal_eq_generateFrom` — and with the
coinduced `patchTopologyOfIdeal` as the compact witness, in which those subsets are clopen by
step (iii). `T0Space` comes from `Spv A` through the subtype instance. -/

/-- **Wedhorn Lemma 7.5(1), the quasi-compactness half.** Every member of `R` is a quasi-compact
open of `Spv (A, I)` — the property Wedhorn states alongside "basis", and the one that
quasi-compactness in `Spv A` does *not* supply, since `Spv (A, I)` is not closed there.

Same witness topology as the spectrality proof, so the patch criterion's
`isCompact_of_isClopen_generateFrom` applies directly. -/

Spectrality is tested on the basis `R` (`isSpectralMap_of_isTopologicalBasis` with
`isTopologicalBasis_rationalFamily`), where the preimage of a rational subset is computed by
step (iii) and is quasi-compact in `Spv A` unconditionally. -/

/-! ### The sub-unit locus is pro-constructible in `Spv (A, I)` -/

/-- **The locus `v ≤ 1` on a set of ring elements is pro-constructible in `Spv (A, I)`.** Its
trace is the intersection over `a ∈ S` of the rational subsets `Spv(A,I)({a,1}/1)`, each a
quasi-compact open of the subspace by `isCompact_of_mem_rationalFamily` — carrying `1` among
the numerators makes the pair admissible for any `I` (`isAdmissible_of_one_mem`).

This is the form Wedhorn's Theorem 7.35 consumes at `S = A⁺`. It does not follow from the
corresponding `Spv A` statement by restriction — the inclusion `Spv (A, I) → Spv A` is not
spectral — which is why it is proved here from the rational family instead. -/
