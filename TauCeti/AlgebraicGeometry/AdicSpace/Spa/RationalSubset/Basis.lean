# The rational basis of the adic spectrum

**Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1), Definition 7.29, Remark 7.30(5),
and Theorem 7.35.**

Let `P = (A₀,I)` be a pair of definition of a Huber ring. The rational subsets

```text
R(T/s) = {v ∈ Spa(A,A⁺) : v(t) ≤ v(s) ≠ 0 for every t ∈ T}
```

for which the ideal `T · A` is open form a basis of quasi-compact opens of `Spa(A,A⁺)`.
The proof compares them with the rational basis of `Spv(A,IA)`. By Wedhorn Lemma 6.6,
openness of `T · A` implies admissibility for `IA`; conversely, an admissible pair `(T,s)`
has open numerator ideal after inserting `s` among the numerators, which does not change its
rational subset. This comparison also transports closure under intersections and quasi-compactness.

Closure under intersection appears in two strengths. Remark 7.30(5) is the binary statement,
recorded here as `inter_mem_spaRationalFamily`; Theorem 7.35(2) asserts the stronger claim that
the basis is stable under *finite* intersection. The finite form is the one a common refinement
of a finite rational cover consumes, and it carries no nonemptiness hypothesis.

The plus ring is arbitrary here. The additional condition that it be a ring of integral
elements is part of calling the resulting space the adic spectrum of a Huber pair, but none of
the basis arguments uses it.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spaRationalFamily`: the family of rational subsets with open
  numerator ideal, viewed as subsets of `spa Aplus`.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spaRationalOpens`: the same family presented as a set of `Opens`,
  the form the sheaf-theoretic consumers take.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.inter_mem_spaRationalFamily`: the family is closed under binary
  intersections, which is Wedhorn Remark 7.30(5).
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.biInter_mem_spaRationalFamily`: the family is closed under *finite*
  intersections, which is the stability clause of Wedhorn Theorem 7.35(2). It is stated over a
  `Finset` index, with `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.iInter_mem_spaRationalFamily` for a finite index
  type and `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.sInter_mem_spaRationalFamily` for a finite subfamily, the
  form a refinement argument produces.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.finiteInter_spaRationalFamily`: the same closure as Mathlib's
  `FiniteInter` structure, which the three forms above are read off.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.inf_mem_spaRationalOpens` and
  `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.finsetInf_mem_spaRationalOpens`: the same two closure statements in
  the bundled `Opens` form, together with `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.top_mem_spaRationalOpens`.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.isTopologicalBasis_spaRationalFamily`: the family is a basis for
  the topology of `spa Aplus`, with `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.isBasis_spaRationalOpens` the same
  statement in the `Opens.IsBasis` form.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.isCompact_of_mem_spaRationalFamily`: every member of the family is
  quasi-compact. Each result also has an `_of_pairOfDefinition` form for use with a specified
  pair of definition.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.exists_finite_spaRationalFamily_refinement`: every open cover of a
  member of the family admits a finite refinement by members of the family — the two results
  above combined, and the form a sheaf criterion on this basis consumes.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spa_eq_biUnion_rationalSubset_of_isTateRing_of_isOpen`: over a Tate
  ring, if a finite set `T` generates an open ideal, then the standard rational subsets cover
  `spa Aplus` (Wedhorn Corollary 7.53 specialization).
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.exists_unit_forall_mem_spa_exists_vlt`: for a finite standard cover
  of a Tate ring, a unit is strictly dominated at every point by some numerator.

One correction to the source: Wedhorn's proof of Theorem 7.35(2) cites Remark 7.30(4) for
stability under finite intersection, but 7.30(4) is the statement that `R(T/s)` is rational
for a unit `s`. The binary intersection this file iterates is Remark 7.30(5).

/-! ### Finite rational refinements -/

/-- **Every open cover of a rational subset admits a finite refinement by rational subsets.**
This is the previous two results combined: being a basis shrinks each point's cover member to a
rational neighbourhood, and quasi-compactness then keeps finitely many of them. It is the shape a
sheaf criterion on the rational basis consumes, where the cover is arbitrary but the Čech complex
must be built from the basis itself.

The two-step argument follows AINTLIB's `exists_finite_rational_refinement_huber` and its Tate-only
`exists_finite_rational_refinement` (branch `dev/adic-spaces`, commit `37bbdaeb`, Apache 2.0), in
`projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/RestrictedLimitSheaf.lean`. Two differences: quasi-compactness is a
hypothesis there and is discharged here by `isCompact_of_mem_spaRationalFamily`; and the conclusion
there is a `Finset` of a bundled index type over `RationalLocData`, whereas this states a finite
subfamily of `spaRationalFamily` with the containment as a side condition, matching the vocabulary
this file already uses. -/
