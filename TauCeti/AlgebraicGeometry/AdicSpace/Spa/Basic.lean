# The underlying set of the adic spectrum `Spa (A, A⁺)`

**The set-level construction beneath Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1),
Definition 7.23.**

For a subring `A⁺` of a commutative ring `A` with a topology, `spa A⁺` is the set of continuous
points of `Spv A` that are sub-unit on `A⁺`:

```text
spa A⁺ = {v ∈ cont A | v(a) ≤ 1 for every a ∈ A⁺}.
```

This is stated for arbitrary data — the file assumes `[TopologicalSpace A]` and nothing
relating the topology to the ring operations, and asks nothing of the subring. It **is**
Wedhorn's adic spectrum `Spa (A, A⁺)` under the hypotheses his Definition 7.23 carries: `A` a
Huber ring (so in particular a topological ring, which is also what makes membership in
`cont A` Wedhorn's Definition 7.7) and `A⁺` a ring of integral elements. Those hypotheses
enter only where theorems need them — spectrality (Wedhorn Theorem 7.35) is the first such
theorem, and it lives with the `Spv (A, I)` machinery it consumes, not in this file. This
mirrors how `cont` itself is defined below its Wedhorn hypotheses.

Following the roadmap's conventions, the plus ring is an explicit `Subring A` argument and the
spectrum is a `Set (Spv A)`, so a point is a valuation up to equivalence with no chosen value
group, and the subspace topology is the one the coercion `↥(spa Aplus)` carries. (Mathlib's
in-flight `SpaPoint` of mathlib4#42315 instead bundles a representative valuation with a chosen
value group — the representation the roadmap warns must be compared before later layers may use
it; the subspace form here needs no such comparison.)

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spa` : the adic spectrum of `(A, A⁺)`, as a `Set (Spv A)`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spa_def` and `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.mem_spa_iff` : the
  set-level and membership-level characterizations — the definition is not exposed across the
  module boundary, so these two are the exported interface.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spa_antitone` : the spectrum shrinks as the plus ring grows. Its
  inclusion into `Cont A` is `spa_def ▸ Set.inter_subset_left`.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spa_integralClosure` : replacing the plus ring by its integral
  closure leaves `Spa` unchanged.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spa_topologicalClosure` : over a semitopological ring, replacing the
  plus ring by its topological closure leaves `Spa` unchanged.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spa_eq_empty_of_one_mem_closure_zero` : if `1 ∈ closure {0}` in a
  commutative ring `A` with separately continuous addition, then `Spa(A, A⁺) = ∅` for any plus
  ring `A⁺` (the `1 ∈ closure {0} → Spa(A, A⁺) = ∅` half of Wedhorn Proposition 7.49(1)).
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.trivialSection_mem_spa_iff` : the trivial valuation of a prime is a
  point of the adic spectrum exactly when the prime is open, for any plus ring.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.eq_top_of_spa_eq_empty` : an empty adic spectrum forces every open
  ideal to be the unit ideal.
The converse and the full separated-quotient criterion of Wedhorn Proposition 7.49(1) require
the Huber-pair hypotheses and are proved in
`TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.AdicSpace.Spa.Emptiness`.

## Provenance

`trivialSection_mem_spa_iff` is the trivial-valuation witness of AINTLIB
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0), branch `dev/adic-spaces` at commit
`37bbdaeb9ad9e3bc9f0d660feadc2779e455a91c`, project `projects/AdicSpaces/`, file
`Adic spaces/AdicSpectrum.lean`, section `Prop752`, with the valuation-spectrum vocabulary adapted
to this repository's `Spv`/`ValuativeRel` interface and the introduction direction strengthened to
an equivalence. It reached this file by being factored out of
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/AdicSpace/Spa/Points.lean`, which had used it inline.

/-- The continuous points of `Spv A` that are sub-unit on the subring `A⁺`, as a
`Set (Spv A)` — the subspace topology is the one the coercion `↥(spa Aplus)` carries.

For a Huber ring `A` and a ring of integral elements `A⁺` this is **Wedhorn's adic spectrum
`Spa (A, A⁺)`** (Definition 7.23); the definition itself asks for neither — an arbitrary
subring of an arbitrary commutative ring with a topology — and the Wedhorn hypotheses enter
only in later theorems. -/
def spa (Aplus : Subring A) : Set (Spv A) :=
  cont A ∩ {v : Spv A | ∀ a ∈ Aplus, v.toValuativeRel.vle a 1}

/-- The set-level characterization of the adic spectrum: `spa` is the intersection of the
continuous locus with the sub-unit locus of the plus ring. The definition is not exposed
across the module boundary, so this equation is how consumers apply set-level results to
`spa` — for instance `spa_def ▸ Set.inter_subset_left : spa Aplus ⊆ cont A`. -/

plus ring: `v ∈ Spa (A, A⁺)` iff `v` is continuous and `v(a) ≤ 1` for every `a ∈ A⁺`. -/

/-- The trivial valuation of a prime `p` is a point of the adic spectrum exactly when `p` is open,
for any plus ring `A⁺`: the sub-unit condition holds at every element of `A`, since a trivial
valuation takes only the values `0` and `1` and `1` lies outside a prime. -/
