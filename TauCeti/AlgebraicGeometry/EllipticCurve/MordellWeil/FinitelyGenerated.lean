# Finite generation of the group of rational points

The descent is complete: the weak Mordell–Weil theorem gives that `E(K)/2E(K)` is finite, the
naïve height satisfies the approximate parallelogram law and the Northcott property, and Mathlib's
descent engine `AddCommGroup.fg_of_descent'` turns those two into finite generation of `E(K)`.
Finiteness of the torsion subgroup comes out of the same two inputs and is Mathlib's
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finite_torsion`.

The statements are named for their conclusions, per the roadmap: no declaration is called
`mordellWeil`, and the classical name appears in docstrings only.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.fg_point` : `E(K)` is finitely generated, for a curve in the normal
  form `y² = f(x)` over the fraction field of a Dedekind domain, under per-factor class-group and
  unit-group finiteness.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.fg_point_of_variableChange` : the same for an arbitrary Weierstrass
  curve, transferred along an admissible change of variables.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.fg_point_of_numberField` : **the Mordell–Weil theorem** — `E(K)` is
  finitely generated for an elliptic curve over a number field.

## Two divergences from the source, both forced by what is already on `main`

*Unit groups are `Monoid.FG`, not `Group.FG`.* The source states `fg_point` with
`Group.FG (ringOfIntegersFactor R p)ˣ`, but `main`'s weak Mordell–Weil theorem
(`finiteIndex_range_nsmulAddMonoidHom_two`) takes `Monoid.FG`. Matching `main` avoids an
impedance mismatch at the one place the hypothesis is used; `Group.fg_iff_monoid_fg` converts,
and `fg_point_of_numberField` does exactly that when discharging it from Dirichlet's theorem.

*The finiteness inputs are `TauCeti`'s.* `NumberField.finite_classGroup_integralClosure` and
`NumberField.fg_units_integralClosure` are in
`TauCeti.NumberTheory.NumberField.IntegralClosure`, since they are general number theory and
mention no curve.

/-- **The Mordell–Weil theorem**, general version: `E(K)` is finitely generated, for an elliptic
curve `E` given by an equation `y² = f(x)` with a monic cubic `f` (`a₁ = a₃ = 0`) over a field `K`
such that `K` has admissible absolute values with the Northcott property, `K` is the fraction
field of a Dedekind domain `R`, and for each irreducible factor `p` of `f` the integral closure of
`R` in `K[X] ⧸ (p)` has finite class group and finitely generated unit group.

For `K` a number field all of these hold; see `fg_point_of_numberField`.

The per-factor hypotheses cannot be replaced by the corresponding hypotheses on `R` itself: by a
theorem of Claborn, refined by Leedham-Green and by Clark, *every* abelian group is the class
group of the integral closure of a PID in a separable quadratic extension, so
`Finite (ClassGroup R)` gives no control over the class groups of the factors. -/

given an admissible change of variables `C` bringing `E` into the normal form `y² = f(x)`,
together with the finiteness hypotheses of `fg_point` for the model `C • E`. The result transfers
along the isomorphism of point groups `Point.equivVariableChange`.

Such a `C` exists whenever `2` is invertible in `K`, by completing the square. -/

  [W.toAffine.IsElliptic]

/-- **The Mordell–Weil theorem**: the group `E(K)` of `K`-rational points of an elliptic curve `E`
over a number field `K` is finitely generated.

The square on the left-hand side is completed by an admissible change of variables, possible since
`K` has characteristic zero, and the finiteness hypotheses of `fg_point` for the resulting model
are the class number theorem and Dirichlet's unit theorem. -/
