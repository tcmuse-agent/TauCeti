# Normal forms: transport, changes of variables, and elementary consequences

Mathlib's `WeierstrassCurve.IsCharNeTwoNF` asserts `a₁ = a₃ = 0` and its
`WeierstrassCurve.IsShortNF` asserts `a₁ = a₂ = a₃ = 0`, and its `NormalForms` file proves a
great deal from those hypotheses. This file collects four things it does not record.

**Transport.** Both conditions are preserved by `map` and `baseChange` — the coefficients of
`W.map f` are the images of `W`'s, so a vanishing coefficient stays vanishing.

**Completing the square.** The change `toCharNeTwoNF` gives explicit formulas for its three
remaining coefficients.

**Changes of variables between short normal forms.** When `2` and `3` are non-zero-divisors, a
change of variables carrying one short equation to another is a pure scaling
`(x, y) ↦ (u²x, u³y)`: its `r`, `s` and `t` vanish, so it acts on the coefficients by
`(a₄, a₆) ↦ (u⁻⁴a₄, u⁻⁶a₆)`. This is the only freedom left in a short equation, and it is what a
canonical short equation has to normalise away.

**Elementary consequences.** Facts that follow from `a₁ = a₃ = 0` alone, by unfolding `negY`, with
no further machinery. `y_eq_zero_of_order_two` is the current example: negation is `(x, y) ↦
(x, -y)`, so a `2`-torsion point has `y = 0`. It lives here rather than with the division-polynomial
material that first proved it because it needs none of that — this module's closure is one file,
against thirty-three for `DivisionPolynomial/ShortNagellLutz.lean` — and its consumers, Nagell–Lutz
and the `2`-descent torsion count, sit in unrelated parts of the library.

That gap matters as soon as a statement is about a curve over `ℤ` and a point over `ℚ`, which is
the shape of the classical Nagell–Lutz theorem: the hypothesis is natural on the integral model,
while the point lives on the base change, and without these instances the class has to be
re-established by hand at every such crossing.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.isCharNeTwoNF_map`: `a₁ = a₃ = 0` is preserved by a ring hom.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isCharNeTwoNF_baseChange`: the same for a base change, which is the spelling
  consumers hold. Both are instances, so the crossing is silent.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isShortNF_map` and `WeierstrassCurve.isShortNF_baseChange`: the same two
  statements for short normal form.
* `WeierstrassCurve.VariableChange.r_eq_zero_of_isShortNF`, `…s_eq_zero_of_isShortNF` and
  `…t_eq_zero_of_isShortNF`: a change of variables between short normal forms is a scaling.
* `WeierstrassCurve.variableChange_a₄_of_isShortNF` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.variableChange_a₆_of_isShortNF`: it acts on the coefficients by
  `(a₄, a₆) ↦ (u⁻⁴a₄, u⁻⁶a₆)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.y_eq_zero_of_order_two`: in a characteristic-≠-2 normal form, an affine
  point killed by `2` has `y = 0`.
* `TauCeti.toCharNeTwoNF_a₂`, `TauCeti.toCharNeTwoNF_a₄`, and `TauCeti.toCharNeTwoNF_a₆`:
  the coefficients after completing the square.

/-! ### Changes of variables between short normal forms

The coefficients `a₁`, `a₃` and `a₂` of `C • W` are `u⁻¹ · 2s`, `u⁻³ · 2t` and `u⁻² · 3r` when `W`
is short, so if `C • W` is short as well and `2` and `3` are non-zero-divisors then
`r = s = t = 0`, and `C` is the scaling `(x, y) ↦ (u²x, u³y)`. -/

/-- **In characteristic-≠-2 normal form, a two-torsion point has `y = 0`.** Negation is
`(x, y) ↦ (x, -y)`, so a point equal to its own negative has `2y = 0`; cancelling `2` finishes it.

Nothing here sees `ℤ` or `ℚ`, and nothing needs `a₂ = 0`: the argument is the normal-form identity
plus the ability to cancel `2` in the point's own field, so those are exactly the hypotheses.

The hypothesis is annihilation by `2` rather than `addOrderOf P = 2`, which is what the proof and
every caller actually have. For an *affine* point the two are equivalent — `Point.some _ _ _` is
never `0` — so the name remains exact; the weaker form simply spares callers the reconstruction. -/
