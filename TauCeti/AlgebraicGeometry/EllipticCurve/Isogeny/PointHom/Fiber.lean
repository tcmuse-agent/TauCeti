# Fibres of the class-group point map

Over a separably closed field, every fibre of a separable isogeny's point map has exactly
the degree of the isogeny many points. In particular, the point map is surjective, and its
kernel is finite with cardinality equal to the degree.

The map here is `Isogeny.toPointHom`, defined by extension and norm on ideal classes.
The point--place dictionary intertwines it with restriction of places. Complete splitting
then identifies its fibres with the finite fibres of restriction, including over infinity.
Separably closed constants suffice: the residue extensions are separable because the
isogeny is unramified, so every place above a rational place is again rational.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.ncard_fiber_toPointHom_eq_degree`: every point fibre has size `deg φ`.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.toPointHom_surjective`: a separable isogeny is surjective on points over
  a separably closed field.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.card_ker_toPointHom_eq_degree`: the point kernel has cardinality `deg φ`.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.finite_ker_toPointHom`: the point kernel is finite.
