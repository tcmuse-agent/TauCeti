# Function-field pullbacks of isogenies

This file proves that the coordinate pullback of an isogeny is injective and extends it uniquely
to the function fields. Both rest on one nonconstancy statement: the pulled-back target
coordinate is transcendental over the base field, since otherwise pointedness would make the
source coordinate algebraic as well, against its transcendence. Injectivity is then the
observation that a nonzero element of the kernel has a nonzero norm over the target's polynomial
subring, and that norm is a polynomial relation killing the pulled-back coordinate.

That extension is what lets isogenies be composed: a coordinate pullback lands in a *function*
field, so composing two of them needs the outer one extended across the inner one's fraction
field. `TauCeti.Isogeny.comp` therefore lives here rather than beside `TauCeti.Isogeny.id` in
`Isogeny/Basic.lean` — this is the first file where it can be stated.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.transcendental_pullback_X`: the pullback of the affine coordinate `x` is
  transcendental over the base field. This is the nonconstancy step, and the source of a
  transcendental element inside the pulled-back function field.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.pullback_injective`: a coordinate pullback satisfying `MapsInfinity` is
  injective.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.fieldPullback`: the induced embedding of function fields.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.comap_fieldPullback_apply_algebraMap`: a valuation restricted along the
  pullback, evaluated on an affine function of the target, is the valuation of its coordinate
  pullback.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.comp`: composition of isogenies, with `TauCeti.Isogeny.comp_fieldPullback`
  its function-field law and `TauCeti.Isogeny.id_comp`, `TauCeti.Isogeny.comp_id`,
  `TauCeti.Isogeny.comp_assoc` the unit and associativity laws. The pointedness obligation is
  discharged privately when `comp` is defined.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.isScalarTower_fieldPullback`: the three pullbacks of a composite make
  `F(W₃) ⊆ F(W₂) ⊆ F(W₁)` a scalar tower — the shared opening of the multiplicativity-under-
  composition proofs in `Isogeny/Degree.lean` and `Isogeny/Separability.lean`.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.comp_right_injective` and `TauCeti.Isogeny.comp_right_inj`: precomposition
  by a fixed isogeny is injective. Equivalently, a factorisation `ψ = λ.comp φ` through a fixed
  `φ` determines its factor `λ` uniquely — the uniqueness half of factoring an isogeny, reached
  without the group structure on `Hom` that Silverman's subtraction argument uses.

Adapted from the AINTLIB project (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, at revision
`2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08`, Apache 2.0 per the source file's header, by Chris
Birkbeck): `projects/HasseWeil/HasseWeil/EC/IsogenyAG/CanonicalDual.lean`, declaration
`Isogeny.compose_right_cancel`. The source states it for an isogeny structure that carries the
point map as an independent field, so its proof passes through `ext_toCurveMap`; here an isogeny
is determined by its pullback, so pullback extensionality suffices.

The degree of an isogeny — the dimension of `W₁.FunctionField` over the image of `fieldPullback`
— is `TauCeti.Isogeny.degree`, in `Isogeny/Degree.lean`; it is stated there rather than here
because the finiteness that makes it honest is proved from `transcendental_pullback_X` together
with the degree of the function field over the rational function field.

The construction is the coordinate-ring form of D. Angdinata's function-field definition of an
isogeny and follows the nonconstancy argument described in the elliptic-curves roadmap. The
composition definition follows the seed in `TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/Suggested.lean`,
discharging the `mapsInfinity` obligation the seed leaves open. The geometric interpretation is
