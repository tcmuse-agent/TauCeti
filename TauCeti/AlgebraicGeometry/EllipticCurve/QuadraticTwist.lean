# The quadratic twist of a Weierstrass curve: definition and invariants

The quadratic twist `E.quadraticTwistOf t n` of a Weierstrass curve by parameters `(t, n)` — to
be thought of as the trace and norm of a generator `θ` of a separable quadratic extension
`L/K`, with `D := t² - 4n` the discriminant of its minimal polynomial — together with the
behaviour of the standard invariants under twisting, uniformly in the characteristic: over any
commutative ring `b₂, b₄, b₆` scale by `D, D², D³`, `c₄, c₆` by `D², D³`, and `Δ` by `D⁶`, so
the twist of an elliptic curve is elliptic exactly when `D` is a unit — over a field, when
`D ≠ 0` —
with the same `j`-invariant. Twisting by a split quadratic, twisting twice by `(t, n)`, or
changing `(t, n)` to the trace and norm of another generator, all move the twist by an explicit
change of variables, again over any commutative ring in which the relevant parameter is a unit.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.quadraticTwistOf`: the quadratic twist of a Weierstrass curve by `(t, n)`,
  an explicit Weierstrass model over any commutative ring.
* `WeierstrassCurve.nodePolynomial_coeff_zero_quadraticTwistOf`: the constant coefficient of
  `nodePolynomial` is the one quantity here that does **not** simply scale by a power of
  `t² - 4n`; it acquires `+ D² n a₁² c₄`. Splitting of the node polynomial is not determined by
  this coefficient alone, so this is a record of how it transforms, not a reduction statement.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Δ_quadraticTwistOf`, `WeierstrassCurve.c₄_quadraticTwistOf`,
  `WeierstrassCurve.c₆_quadraticTwistOf`: the invariants of the twist.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isElliptic_quadraticTwistOf_iff` and its field specialisation
  `WeierstrassCurve.isElliptic_quadraticTwistOf`, and `WeierstrassCurve.j_quadraticTwistOf`: the
  twist of an elliptic curve is elliptic exactly when `t² - 4n` is a unit — over a field, when
  it is nonzero — with equal `j`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.exists_smul_eq_quadraticTwistOf_quadraticTwistOf`,
  `WeierstrassCurve.exists_smul_quadraticTwistOf_eq`: the double twist is isomorphic to the
  original curve, and changing the generator moves the twist by a change of variables.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isElliptic_quadraticTwistOf_trace_norm`,
  `WeierstrassCurve.exists_smul_quadraticTwistOf_trace_norm_eq`: the twist by the trace and norm
  of a generator `θ` of a *separable* quadratic extension `L/K` is elliptic when `E` is, and
  changing the generator moves it by a change of variables — which is what makes the twist by the
  extension well posed.
* `WeierstrassCurve.quadraticTwist`: **the** quadratic twist of `E` by a *separable* quadratic
  extension `L/K`, the twist by the trace and norm of a generator chosen by
  `Algebra.IsQuadraticExtension.exists_discrim_ne_zero`. Separability is required: without it the
  extension could be purely inseparable, where the trace form vanishes and the model is singular
  for every `E`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.exists_quadraticTwist_eq`: elimination — the twist *equals* the twist by the
  trace and norm of some generator, so everything above about `quadraticTwistOf` transfers.
  `WeierstrassCurve.exists_smul_quadraticTwist_eq` adds that any other generator gives the same
  curve up to a change of variables.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isElliptic_quadraticTwist` (an `instance`) and
  `WeierstrassCurve.j_quadraticTwist`: the twist of an elliptic curve is elliptic, with the same
  `j`-invariant.
* `WeierstrassCurve.quadraticTwistOfTraceNormVariableChange`: the explicit change of variables over
  `L` carrying the twist by `θ` back to `E`, with
  `WeierstrassCurve.quadraticTwistOfTraceNormVariableChange_smul_baseChange` saying that it does
  so — the twist is an `L`-form of `E` — and
  `WeierstrassCurve.map_quadraticTwistOfTraceNormVariableChange` giving the Galois cocycle it
  carries:
  conjugating it by the nontrivial `σ ∈ Gal(L/K)` changes it by `negVariableChange`. The witness
  is a definition rather than an existential precisely because the cocycle identity is a
  statement about *this* change of variables and not about an arbitrary one carrying the twist
  to `E`. `WeierstrassCurve.exists_smul_quadraticTwist_baseChange_eq` is the corresponding
  statement for `quadraticTwist` itself, where the generator is the one chosen internally.
* `WeierstrassCurve.quadraticTwistVariableChange`: the same change of variables in the other
  direction, carrying `E` to the twist, at the generator `quadraticTwist` chooses internally —
  the inverse of the previous one, with `WeierstrassCurve.quadraticTwistVariableChange_smul` and the
  cocycle `WeierstrassCurve.map_quadraticTwistVariableChange`, where the `negVariableChange` factor
  sits on the right because inverting a product reverses it.
* `WeierstrassCurve.not_exists_smul_quadraticTwist_eq` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.exists_smul_eq_or_exists_smul_eq_quadraticTwist`: **the classification**, for
  `j ∉ {0, 1728}`. The twist is not `K`-isomorphic to `E`, and any curve becoming isomorphic to
  `E` over `L` is `K`-isomorphic to one of the two. This is where the cocycle is used: forms are
  classified by `H¹(Gal(L/K), Aut Eᴸ) = Hom(ℤ/2, {±1})`, of order two, and the two branches of
  the proof are its two classes.

These are the `quadraticTwistOf` seeds of `TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` §Layer 5
(twists), pinned in that roadmap's `Suggested.lean`, together with the extension twist they make
well posed, the classification of the `L`-forms that the cocycle delivers, and the point
isomorphism `quadraticTwistPointEquiv` that `quadraticTwistVariableChange` induces; the
split-multiplicative-reduction theorem is a later milestone of the same layer and builds on this
file.

## The point isomorphism

Over any field `M` in a tower `K ⊆ L ⊆ M`, the base change of `quadraticTwistVariableChange`
carries `E` to its twist (`quadraticTwistVariableChange_smul_baseChange`) and satisfies the
cocycle identity (`map_quadraticTwistVariableChange_baseChange`). Transporting along it gives
`quadraticTwistPointEquiv : ((E.quadraticTwist L)⁄M).Point ≃+ (E⁄M).Point`, with
`quadraticTwistPointEquiv_some` the coordinate equation a consumer needs. It is natural in `M`
(`quadraticTwistPointEquiv_map`) and **anti-equivariant** for the Galois elements that move `L`
(`quadraticTwistPointEquiv_map_eq_neg_map_of_not_fixed`): that sign is what makes the twist a
twist. `quadraticTwistPointEquiv_map_eq_quadraticCharacter_smul_map` packages the two cases as
`φ(σP) = χ(σ|_L) • σ(φP)`, uniformly in `σ`, where `χ` is
`Algebra.IsQuadraticExtension.quadraticCharacter` — the
`Gal(L/K) →* ℤˣ` sending the nontrivial automorphism to `-1`. That is the canonical form of the
statement: the isomorphism is defined over `L` rather than over `K`, and `χ` measures precisely
that failure.

The twist by a generator is deliberately **not** given its own constructor here. Such a
definition would accept any field extension, and outside the finite-dimensional case Mathlib's
`Algebra.trace` and `Algebra.norm` are `0` and `1`, so every `θ` would yield the same unrelated
`(0, 1)` twist. The results below instead name `Algebra.trace K L θ` and `Algebra.norm K θ`
directly and carry `[Algebra.IsQuadraticExtension K L]`, where the construction has its intended
meaning.

Adapted from the FLT project's quadratic-twist development (`ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT`,

`Authors: Kevin Buzzard, Claude`, and it has not been touched in FLT since `bc2fe8ff7396`, so

/-- The quadratic twist of a Weierstrass curve `E` over `K` by parameters `t`, `n`, to be
thought of as the trace and norm of a generator `θ` of a separable quadratic extension `L/K`
(so that `θ² = tθ - n`, and `D := t² - 4n` is the discriminant of the minimal polynomial of
`θ`). The parameters are arbitrary elements of any commutative ring `A`; the reading of `(t, n)`
as the trace and norm of a generator of a separable quadratic extension, with `D ≠ 0` the
separability criterion, is the field case. Over a general commutative ring the condition that
makes the twist behave — and the hypothesis the results below take — is that `D` be a *unit*.

The construction: writing the equation of `E` as `y² + A(x)y = f(x)` with `A(x) = a₁x + a₃`,
the functions `x` and `Y := (t - 2θ)y - θ·A(x)` on `E` are invariant under the Galois action
twisted by the quadratic character of `L/K`, and satisfy
`Y² + t·A(x)·Y = D·(y² + A(x)y) - n·A(x)²`; clearing denominators via `(x, Y) ↦ (Dx, DY)`
turns this relation into the Weierstrass model below of the twist:

`y² + ta₁·xy + Dta₃·y = x³ + (Da₂ - na₁²)·x² + (D²a₄ - 2Dna₁a₃)·x + (D³a₆ - D²na₃²)`.

Its discriminant is `D⁶·Δ(E)` (`Δ_quadraticTwistOf`), so the twist of an elliptic curve is
elliptic exactly when `D` is a unit (`isElliptic_quadraticTwistOf_iff`) — over a field, when
`D ≠ 0` (`isElliptic_quadraticTwistOf`) — with the same `j`-invariant (`j_quadraticTwistOf`).

Sanity checks. If `char K ≠ 2` we may take `θ = √d`, so `t = 0`, `n = -d`, `D = 4d`; for
`E : y² = x³ + a₂x² + a₄x + a₆` the model is `y² = x³ + 4da₂x² + 16d²a₄x + 64d³a₆`, the
classical twist by `4d ≡ d mod (K^×)²`. If `char K = 2` we may take `θ` with `θ² + θ = d`
(Artin–Schreier), so `t = 1`, `n = -d`, `D = 1`; for ordinary `E : y² + xy = x³ + a₂x² + a₆`
the model is the classical twist `y² + xy = x³ + (a₂ + d)x² + a₆`, and for supersingular
`E : y² + a₃y = x³ + a₄x + a₆` it is `y² + a₃y = x³ + a₄x + (a₆ + da₃²)`. -/

general commutative ring, it can vanish from zero divisors without any factor being zero.

Whether the node polynomial splits over the residue field is what distinguishes split from
non-split multiplicative reduction, so a twist can change that behaviour — but splitting is not
determined by this coefficient alone, and this lemma establishes no reduction statement by itself.
It records the coefficient's transformation, which such an argument would use (for instance in the
characteristic-two Artin–Schreier calculation), and nothing more. -/

/-- The quadratic twist by a generator `θ` of a quadratic extension `L/K` depends on the choice
of `θ` only up to isomorphism over `K`: all generators give isomorphic twists. This is what
makes the twist by the extension itself well posed. Separability is not needed — only the trace
and norm of `b + aθ`, which any quadratic extension supplies. -/

/-- **The quadratic twist of `E` by the separable quadratic extension `L/K`**: the twist by the
trace and norm of a generator of `L/K`. The choice of generator is harmless —
`exists_quadraticTwist_eq` names one, and `exists_smul_quadraticTwist_eq` says every other gives
the same curve up to a change of variables over `K`.

Separability is not decoration. On a purely inseparable quadratic extension the trace form
vanishes, so `t = 0` and — in characteristic `2`, the only characteristic where such an extension
exists — the discriminant `D = t² - 4n` is `0`, and the model is singular for every `E` and
barely depends on `E`. This is a different failure from the one the module docstring gives for
refusing a twist-by-a-generator constructor, which is `(t, n) = (0, 1)` and so `D = -4`: there
the parameters cease to reflect the extension but the twist stays generically nonsingular. The
two coincide only in characteristic `2`. Choosing the generator by
`Algebra.IsQuadraticExtension.exists_discrim_ne_zero` rules this case out, so the *twist
parameters* never degenerate. That is all it can rule out: `E` is arbitrary here, so a singular
`E` still gives a singular twist. Nonsingularity of the result needs `E` elliptic too, which is
`isElliptic_quadraticTwist`. -/

the base change to `M` of the change of variables carrying `E` to its twist over `L`. It is
natural in `M` (`quadraticTwistPointEquiv_map`) and anti-equivariant for the Galois elements that
move `L` (`quadraticTwistPointEquiv_map_eq_neg_map_of_not_fixed`);
`quadraticTwistPointEquiv_map_eq_quadraticCharacter_smul_map` bundles those two branches into a
single statement, uniform in `σ`, twisted by the quadratic character of `L/K`.

Like the twist itself this is well defined only up to an `L`-automorphism of `E` — generically up
to sign — and this definition makes one arbitrary choice, consistently across all `M`. -/
