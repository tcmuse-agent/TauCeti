# Minimal models: a criterion, their comparison, and what transfers between them

Mathlib defines `WeierstrassCurve.IsMinimal` by a maximality property — the valuation of the
discriminant is maximal among all integral models isomorphic to the given one — and derives
minimality only from that property or from a class that already extends it. Establishing it for a
*given* equation therefore means quantifying over every change of variables, which is not something
a caller can discharge by hand.

This file supplies the cheapest sufficient condition — an integral Weierstrass equation whose `c₄`
is a **unit** at the place is already minimal — and then the comparison any two minimal models
admit: they have the same discriminant valuation, so a change of variables between them has a
scaling factor of valuation `1`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.isMinimal_of_valuation_c₄_eq_one`: over the fraction field of a discrete
  valuation ring, an integral Weierstrass equation with `v (c₄) = 1` is minimal.
* `WeierstrassCurve.exists_smul_eq_minimal`: Mathlib's chosen minimal equation is obtained by a
  change of variables.
* `WeierstrassCurve.exists_smul_minimal_eq_minimal`: chosen minimal equations of isomorphic
  equations are related by a change of variables.
* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_Δ_le_of_isMinimal_smul`: no integral model in the orbit of a minimal
  model has larger `v (Δ)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_Δ_eq_of_isMinimal_smul`: two minimal models related by a change of
  variables have equal `v (Δ)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isMinimal_of_valuation_Δ_eq_of_isMinimal_smul`: conversely, an integral model
  attaining that valuation is minimal.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isMinimal_baseChange_smul`: a change of variables defined over `R` carries a
  minimal model to a minimal model.
* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_u_eq_one_of_isMinimal_smul`: for an elliptic curve, the scaling
  factor of such a change of variables satisfies `v (u) = 1`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.VariableChange.exists_unit_algebraMap_eq_u_of_isMinimal_smul`: the scaling
  factor is the image of a unit of the discrete valuation ring.
* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_Δ_minimal_smul` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_c₄_minimal_smul`: the chosen minimal equations of isomorphic curves
  have the same discriminant and `c₄` valuations.
* `WeierstrassCurve.HasSplitMultiplicativeReduction.of_isMinimal_smul`: split multiplicative
  reduction transfers along such a change of variables.

`valuation_u_eq_one_of_isMinimal_smul` and
`VariableChange.exists_unit_algebraMap_eq_u_of_isMinimal_smul` supply the unit needed for descent.
Turning that into a change of variables actually *defined* over `R` is the job of
`WeierstrassCurve.VariableChange.exists_baseChange_eq_of_smul_eq`, which also consumes integrality
of both models. A change of variables defined over `R` is one the reduction can see, and that is
what carries split multiplicativity across.

## Why this is the useful form

The hypothesis is stated through the adic valuation of `W.c₄ : K`, matching how Mathlib phrases
`WeierstrassCurve.HasMultiplicativeReduction`, whose `multiplicativeReduction` field is exactly
`valuation K (maximalIdeal R) W.c₄ = 1`. That class *extends* `IsMinimal`, so the implication is
not needed to go from multiplicative reduction to minimality — it is needed in the other
direction, to **construct** `HasMultiplicativeReduction` for an equation one has only computed
`c₄` and `Δ` for. That is the shape a quadratic twist arrives in: twisting by a discriminant that
is a unit scales `c₄` by a unit square, so the twist's `c₄` valuation is again `1`, and this
criterion is what turns that computation into minimality of the twisted model.

## Mathematical content

It is the unit-`c₄` case of the Kraus–Laska criterion — the special case "`v (c₄) < 4` or
`v (Δ) < 12` implies minimal" of Silverman, *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*,
Remark VII.1.1, restricted to `v (c₄) = 0`. The proof is direct: a change of variables scales
`c₄` by `u⁻⁴` and `Δ` by `u⁻¹²`, and integrality of the transformed model bounds `v (u⁻⁴)` by
`1`, hence `v (u⁻¹²) ≤ 1`, so no change of variables can raise the discriminant's valuation.

## Provenance

⚠ *mathlib-track*: this is a statement about Mathlib's own `IsMinimal`, with no Tau Ceti
definitions involved, and belongs upstream once its consumers are in place.

Ported from FLT, https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT
@ `bc2fe8ff7396469a16c2a6d51d6117f5825d93a0` (Apache-2.0), file
`FLT/Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Reduction.lean`, by Kevin Buzzard — the source commit
is FLT PR #1088, "Quadratic twist to split multiplicative reduction". Five declarations are taken
from it:

* `isMinimal_of_valuation_c₄_eq_one`;
* `valuation_Δ_aux_smul_le`, here `valuation_Δ_le_of_isMinimal_smul`;
* `valuation_Δ_eq_of_isMinimal_smul`;
* `valuation_u_eq_one_of_isMinimal_smul`;
* `HasSplitMultiplicativeReduction.of_isMinimal_smul`.

The source declaration `HasSplitMultiplicativeReduction.of_isMinimal_smul` no longer exists at
FLT's current head (`9deae05a`), which drops that development entirely; the pinned revision above
is the record of it. It is absent from Mathlib too, whose `IsMinimal` API stops at the pairwise
exclusion of the reduction types and never compares two minimal models.

Statements are taken unchanged except for `of_isMinimal_smul`, which drops the source's
`[IsMinimal R W₁]`: that instance is already implied by its `h₁`, since
`HasSplitMultiplicativeReduction` extends `HasMultiplicativeReduction` extends `IsMinimal`. The
proofs diverge in six places:

* the section's variable block is restated here, and the `open`s are narrowed to those of Mathlib's
  own `Minimal` section (`IsLocalRing` is left closed, since opening it makes `maximalIdeal`
  ambiguous — `ResidueField` is written qualified instead);
* `valuation_Δ_aux_smul_le` is restated here as `valuation_Δ_le_of_isMinimal_smul`, through the
  ordinary valuation of two models related by a change of variables rather than through the
  internal `valuation_Δ_aux` and the orbit of one equation; `valuation_Δ_eq_of_isMinimal_smul` is
  then two applications of it, and `isMinimal_of_valuation_Δ_eq_of_isMinimal_smul` — its converse,
  which the source does not have — is a third;
* the source's `exists_algebraMap_unit_eq_of_valuation_eq_one` — a separate shim of its own, in
  `FLT/Mathlib/RingTheory/Valuation/Discrete/IsDiscreteValuationRing.lean` — is **not ported**.
  Mathlib has since acquired that file, and with it `associated_of_valuation_eq`, which the three
  lines below call directly. The source obtains the unit in the orientation `u • x = 1` and then
  inverts it; taking `associated_of_valuation_eq 1 ↑D.u` instead lands on `algebraMap R K u = D.u`
  with no inversion at all;
* the source's `exists_variableChange_baseChange_eq_of_smul_eq` is this repository's
  `WeierstrassCurve.VariableChange.exists_baseChange_eq_of_smul_eq`, which is stated over
  `IsIntegrallyClosedIn R K` rather than a discrete valuation ring; instance search discharges it
  here;
* the source's `nodePoly_map_splits_smul_iff` is this repository's existing
  `splits_variableChange_nodePolynomial_map_iff`, and the node polynomial reaches Mathlib's class
  field through `nodePolynomial_def`, since the definition's body is not exposed across the module
  boundary;
* the `⁄K` notation is written `baseChange`, and the source's `show … from rfl` scaffolding for it
  is replaced by a single `congrArg`.

variables can increase the valuation of the discriminant: it scales `Δ` by `u⁻¹²` while scaling
`c₄` by `u⁻⁴`, and integrality of the transformed equation forces `v (u⁻⁴) ≤ 1`.

This is the unit-`c₄` case of the Kraus–Laska criterion (Silverman, *AEC*, Remark VII.1.1). The
hypothesis is phrased through the adic valuation of `W.c₄ : K` to match
`WeierstrassCurve.HasMultiplicativeReduction`, so that a curve for which only `c₄` has been
computed can be given its `IsMinimal` field. -/

/-! ### Comparing two minimal models

`IsMinimal` says the discriminant valuation is maximal among integral models. Two minimal models of
the same curve therefore pin each other: each is at least as good as the other, so their
valuations agree, and the change of variables between them can only scale `Δ` by a unit. -/

/-- **A minimal model maximises the discriminant valuation in its orbit**: every integral model
obtained from it by a change of variables has discriminant of at most that valuation. This is the
`valuation`-level reading of Mathlib's `IsMinimal`, whose `MaximalFor` phrasing speaks of
`valuation_Δ_aux` and of the orbit of a fixed equation. -/

This is what makes split multiplicative reduction a property of the curve at the place rather than

transfer is not definitional: it needs `D` to be defined over `R`. Two results combine to give
