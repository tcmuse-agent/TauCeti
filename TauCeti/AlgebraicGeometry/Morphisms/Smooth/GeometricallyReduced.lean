# Smooth morphisms are geometrically reduced

A smooth morphism of schemes has geometrically reduced fibres. After base change to a field,
smoothness is preserved, and an affine cover of the source has smooth coordinate algebras over
the ring of global functions of the target. That ring is isomorphic to the field, so the
coordinate algebras are reduced by `TauCeti.isReduced_of_smooth`.

The main result is the instance `AlgebraicGeometry.Smooth.geometricallyReduced`. Smooth,
geometrically connected morphisms are also shown to be geometrically integral in
`TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Morphisms.Smooth.GeometricallyIntegral`.

No formalization is vendored. The commutative-algebra input is
`TauCeti.isReduced_of_smooth`; the passage from affine opens to the whole scheme uses
Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.IsReduced.of_openCover`.
