# `lint-env` driver: Mathlib's default environment linters, compiled

Human-owned governance machinery, run by `scripts/lint-env.sh`. It does exactly what the
generated `#lint only <linters> in TauCeti` driver used to do, and prints the same report in the
same format, but as a compiled executable.

It is faster because Batteries' lint framework and linters run natively; under `lean` they are
interpreted. Measured on the whole library in 2026-09 (16 cores, identical reports): `lake env lean`
on the generated driver took 257s wall and 3,552 CPU-seconds, this driver compiled took 169s and
2,543. Running this same source interpreted, with `lake env lean --run`, took 226s and 3,399, with
35 million context switches against 8 million compiled; most of the extra CPU is kernel time
(707s against 104s), consistent with interpreted, allocation-heavy linter tasks contending in
Lean's task manager. Userspace instructions differ by only about 10%.

`scripts/build-lint-driver.sh` compiles it in a throwaway Lake workspace that depends on the
project's pinned Batteries by path. In the sandboxed PR build that happens on the host before any
candidate code runs, and the executable is mounted read-only; see `lint-env.sh`.

Usage: `lint-env-driver [--only-listed] <tag> <marker-file> <modules-file> <linter>...`

* Imports every module listed (one per line) in `<modules-file>`. `importModules` loads the closure
  at the `private` olean level, as the legacy (non-module) `#lint` driver did; see PRIVATE
  DECLARATIONS in `lint-env.sh`.
* Runs exactly the named linters on the declarations of the `TauCeti` package, or, with
  `--only-listed`, on just the declarations defined in the listed modules (the TauCeti modules
  they import are not linted). `lint-env.sh` uses that to lint only what a change touched.
* Prints the report `#lint` would print. With violations, the header line carries the
  `<tag>:1:0: error: ` prefix that Lean gives an error diagnostic from a driver file named `<tag>`,
  and the exit code is 1. Without violations, the report is printed bare and the exit code is 0.
* Then prints the contents of `<marker-file>` (a per-run nonce) on its own line, proving the
  process ran past the linters. The nonce is passed in a file rather than on the command line so
  that learning it takes the same two steps as it did for the generated driver file.

`trace.Batteries.Lint` is enabled, so each linter's progress is also printed to stdout. All of it
comes before the report header, and `lint-env.sh` parses only what follows the header. Once Batteries
reports per-linter cost on those trace lines, CI logs will record what each linter costs.
